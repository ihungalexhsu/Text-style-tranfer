by far the worst dining experience i 've ever had in my entire life .
i was so stoked to find a place near me , with good reviews .
very messy and unorganized ... not too many clothes or shoes to choose from .
to make matters worse , the place has all the atmosphere of a warehouse .
i show up a few minutes late and still wait an additional 10-15 minutes .
when you pay for your order her proceeds to walk away after your change .
called early this morning at 8am to schedule an appointment for an oil change .
serve it with a limp iceberg and a bland dressing , that 's how .
i used to love the mussels appetizer , but this visit they were awful .
after he had just patiently stood there waiting for her for over _num_ minutes .
my husband and i went to dq and we went through the drive through .
very rudely he asked if he should do my fix before everyone else 's .
it was easy to shop because there is not many people in the aisles .
even when they about and should be trying to get rid of their food .
long time streets customer who is now done with them for a long time .
i asked for a to go box for a left over roll and shrimp .
i 've stayed at other super _num_ before and it was n't like this .
he was helpful at first but than treated us as if we were stupid .
i will never be back to metro barber shop and not give anymore referrals .
i was told that i would have to wait over a week for repair .
she was not a fan of the hummus she had or the greek salad .
my endless pasta bowl was disgusting , i do n't know a better term .
i built my pie online and set up a carryout option with cash payment .
this place did not and i was unable to finish my $ _num_ cocktail .
i 've had better from other greasy spoon diners and brunch places in california .
surprisingly we did n't wait too long until our party of _num_ was seated .
needs a new transmission , they say `` as is '' i get it .
no touching , no going ahead of people , no <UNK> , no dancing .
this place does n't deserve one start nevertheless the _num_ star rating on hotwire .
here , this dish is bland , tasteless and has little to no seasonings .
_num_ % tip from your bill is more then enough if you ask me .
some basic math and people skills would make the customer experience a lot better !
no one should have to wait _num_ 1/2 hours to complete a vet exam .
i recently went in to a wal-mart establishment in phoenix az store # _num_ .
be polite on the phone , then hang up and talk crap about them .
if you do n't ... well be prepared for your order to be wrong .
i guess if you do n't mind doing that it 's worth $ _num_ .
they do n't carry my series number ( _num_ ) only up to _num_ .
waitress asked if i would like to box it up and i politely declined .
they had some hard working employees also but avoid this one if you can .
mainly a liquor store with gas pumps , some of which are shut down .
i had _num_ minutes to make it to the new location before they closed .
a little more professionalism and significantly more customer appreciation is needed at this company .
some of the doctors are ok im referring to the business as a whole .
it 's not wise to assume everyone knows the way your business is run .
never was waited on while the service desk person took customers out of order .
after _num_ minutes my pizza was out but only the pizza and no wings .
everytime i come to this particular subway i remember why i avoid this one .
the lady that did my pedi did not even put a top coat on .
she was beyond rude , even started talking down about us to the staff .
the cheesy bread was cheesy , crappy , and salty all rolled into one .
which is also a place i would not want to ever go back to .
we stopped by the drive thru sunday morning to pick up two breakfast burritos .
by the time our food got to the table , our drinks were empty .
overall would never visit that location again and would n't advise you to either .
i 'm disappointed to say i 'll be avoiding this one for now on .
the crust on a frozen pizza was better than the crust on this one .
disgusting rooms ... noisy ... smelly ... loaded with homeless people ... horrible experience .
i could go on and on but i am sure you get the point .
not be racist but are they trying to hire any whites any time soon ?
i tell him `` sir , i 'm standing right here in line . ''
i love mexican food and was craving rolled tacos with guacamole and chicken chimichanga .
come on people , the is the usa and thats coming from a hispanic !
i specially asked for a non smoking room but our room smells of smoke .
it had only been used a few times so it still looked brand new .
the lady that answered was extremely rude and did n't care one dam bit .
my wife and i thought the sauce tasted more like ketchup than pizza sauce .
i say again , do n't ever ever ever ever stay at this hotel !
terrible customer service couldnt even tell me how much was on a gift card .
first impression when i walk into the place is the smell of dirty carpets .
anyhow , i think there are probably better places to eat in the area .
you get what you pay for ... stayed here to visit family in goodyear .
there were many customer dogs in the store , and nobody was petting them !
food was warm that was suppose to be cold and chicken wings were old .
i went to wendy 's across the street and had food in _num_ minutes .
needless to say we spent too much money for a not very satisfying meal .
the food is not cooked all the way , and , none wears gloves .
i took my _num_ yr old dog into her first teeth cleaning last week .
floor and ceiling look like they have been rode hard and hung up wet .
when we received our order it was missing country gravy on both our hashbrowns .
the experience was awful and they should have more caring people handling our requests .
i really do n't miss this place nor will i ever crave anything here .
host was friendly , waiter jeremy was super nice and manager was all smiles .
going in with coworkers for a quick bite to eat i ordered the nachos .
at the very best it should have been under $ _num_ for it all .
one time i came in on a friday and only one teller was working .
now this place is just a serious dive with little to no redeeming qualities .
based on my last experience i do n't think i will bring my car back.
got off the phone another _num_ min later the driver got to our house .
it fell short of the layered , fried chicken crust this dish should have .
we waited _num_ minutes while multiple workers walked by before someone would help us .
worst stay of my life , i wish i could get my money back .
i was charged for the cheese too because the total was $ _num_ something .
i was there just as long as if i had ordered in the store .
for some reason , my room had some strawberry jelly all over the place .
it did n't taste horrible , just cheap ... so only a minor fail .
7:30 am , i am told i will have to wait till _num_ am .
the room is simple with a small electric stove , sink , and microwave .
my one take spoon of blue cheese dressing to go with it was ok .
the waiter said i could n't take the shrimp home because it was unlimited .
then i waited another _num_ for a cappuccino that was cold when ordered hot .
i tried to complain and the chick acted like she did n't speak english .
making my wings get cold as i waited for the pizza to get done .
they really need to get some workers in there that know how to cook .
make sure you have time to burn , my mani/pedi took over two hours !
i had the biscuit egg , bacon , and cheese sandwich and the waffle .
this is the third time in a row , we will not be returning !
so he offered to replace the _num_ piece white with _num_ dark meat choices .
so he proceeded to hand me my order and then asked for the money .
after slow service this morning i decided to look up this business on yelp .
i do n't want to spend 10-15 additional minutes of my lunch hour waiting .
this hotel was the worst i have ever stayed in and felt very unsafe .
frankly , i know better than to order wings from a national chain store .
i , along with a couple of friends visited this place last friday night .
which my mom was sitting at who uses a walker and has trouble moving .
the meat is dark , fatty , and does n't even taste like chicken .
another _num_ minutes go by i called back she then told me _num_ minutes .
the selection was better but probably because it 's a ghost town at metro .
i highly recommend that you never go here unless you want to get frustrated .
but domino 's is at least on par with pizza hut and papa johns .
when i entered the store , i did not smell one sense of food .
got a groupon deal that said i would get a synthetic blend oil change .
i asked them to put it on rye instead because that would taste better .
i will not recommend anyone to this location or any of their franchise period .
not the best mexican resturant we 've been to , but it 's cheap !
we gave up on getting him off our backs and walked out without ordering .
the customer service that i experienced here was on par with any other salon .
next , the total was $ _num_ ( i also ordered a blizzard ) .
i gave him the same instructions on how to cut my hair like always .
you 're not going to find any of that useful shit at party city .
the customer service is usually awful and the cashier lines are rarely ever open .
sadly , it took another five mins for our food to arrive , incorrectly .
_num_ hours after we ordered they want to know where to take the pizza .
is their clientele so vast that they can afford to treat people like crap ?
the next morning , we found that the water temperature would n't stay steady .
i also notice that floor was really and there was no wet floor sign .
i had to choose _num_ star otherwise , i could n't post this review !
plus gum on the arm of the chair ( gross ) oh and chips .
if i ever come to phoenix to visit i will not be staying here .
honestly this is one of the worst food dining experiences i have ever had .
wth , potatoes or hash browns & eggs are what makes a breakfast burrito .
ordered a large supreme and it had next to no meat veggies on it .
why are they taking over all the airports , stations , and rest stops ?
i asked if she could void the transaction and again i got a no .
the `` sour '' is n't in the name to make it sound pretty .
i had it transferred to another location and got my meds in _num_ mins .
my husband and i came here because we were missing the seafood back home .
my baby is crying , im hungry , an this is just dumb ... .
every time i drive by the store i 'm reminded of the horrible experience .
we will be searching for another vet and not coming back to this location .
i 'm not sure the food was old or it 's a food poisoning .
luckily i had cash so i paid her for exactly what i had ordered .
so in conclusion , this store ... do n't , just ... do n't .
every encounter i have had with her ... she is always rude or angry .
long story short , _num_ of us returned our meals as they were nasty .
these must have been frozen at some point , they were watery and tasteless .
needless to say , we all stopped eating and felt sick to our stomachs .
my pedicure , however , turned out okay with minimal polish on the skin .
i have to say it 's the worst smelling la fitness in the valley .
i kept telling her no but she continued to insist she must come in .
this place was like a ghost town and no one could even acknowledge us .
the service was very very very very very slow , and a wrong order .
i can deal with poor customer service , but finding glass in a biscuit ?
i would n't write a review on a franchise unless it pissed me off .
unfortunately , i am unable to say the same about my experience here today .
other pizza places always put dips and napkins when you buy pizza from them .
my dough was mushy , crust was soft and had no crisp to it .
they messed up my order and then did n't want to fix it correctly .
they did not bother saying anything until i asked if they were closed .
normally a person will tip _num_ % - _num_ % of their bill .
i went back through the website with another reservation to verify ... yup .
this would have been the second time the tried to double charge me .
if anything , she seemed annoyed that she had to correct the order .
but i am not sure about the frozen lunch meat you are offered .
also missing , fork , napkins , condiments and the traditional fortune cookie .
needless to say , i would n't recommend this company to anyone ever !
it was rated two star on hotwire but that was a real stretch !
failure one was not checking the address or even bothering to take one .
finally , we were pressured to donate our relatives body to medical research .
the bathrooms were very clean and the booth we were in was comfortable .
i leave not even a block away everything comes back on once again .
tried complaining to corporate office and they turned me back to the manager .
of course , i called management and they said they would security immediately .
to be honest the only thing that was good was the fountain drinks .
there are three left and i believe this is the worst of them .
it 's a shame to watch this place take the turn it has .
when she returns to work i realize they gave me chicken and shrimp .
then they did not have the part and rescheduled for the next week !
sammy is my normal barber but he messed my hair up horribly yesterday .
as such , the quality and consistency of the services are not reliable .
i walk away and go to the host and ask for a manager .
i immediately stopped eating and threw it in the trash and left disgusted .
that tells me you are not paying attention to what you are doing .
when she dropped off our food she gave us the check as well .
however , just the other night , i found mold in my pizza .
i got like a pound and it had about three bites of egg .
for something that was their fault so we got our prescription and left .
this gym is always dirty , and equipment is either broken or outdated .
i can excuse the mess because i know how inconsiderate customers can be .
it takes many appointments , and takes longer then _num_ minutes to do !
the neighborhood is bad and it reflects in their attitude toward their customers .
a little over an hour wasted sitting waiting ... absolutely horrible customer service .
they lost touch and do n't know how to deal with the living !
this location on the other hand is dirty , unfriendly , and unprofessional .
in a city with a million bars do n't waste your cash here .
luckily he was wearing leather pants , so he just dried himself off .
this seems to be a trend among courses that i do n't like .
the cashier asked who is going to eat because there is not sharing ?
another _num_ minutes goes by and we have no water and no service .
i feel like sleeping on a park bench would have satisfied me more !
i had her order the steak and shrimp with veggie bowl for me .
was in the area and thought i would stop in for a burger .
i spoke with a manager , erica martin about our happy hour drinks .
did n't offer hot and sour soup at lunch , only egg drop .
my salad was meh and my fianc 's ribs were a little dry .
as im using the restroom one of the workers com in to clean .
not her , and this location is going to pay for her mistake .
i had to spend the day cleaning and getting rid of bed bugs !
i ca n't do this place & will never recommend it to anyone .
we waited _num_ minutes we were not even offered any water or anything .
also , someone said the regulars are a joy to hang out with ?
girl is yelling in the background `` that 's what she ordered ! ''
it took us about _num_ min to get the foods on the table .
why schedule appointments if you ca n't be ready to serve your patients ?
the waitress just left the mess she made for is to clean up .
now pizza is beyond awful and wings are down there with its level .
i have never not had to wait in a 10+ minute wait line .
cons : the first room they put me in stunk of cat urine !
the food looked old , the lettuce wilted , it just looked gross .
she returned a couple mins later with sad fixes , but sorta fixes .
had no idea it was spring training and alot of places were booked .
first bite was great , then my wife commented that it was bleeding .
so i do not recommend this location plus , they hardly have anything .
i the steam rooms door has been cracked for over three months now .
i call them and they apologize and tell me they will refund me .
i do n't know what happened but the mongolian bbq no longer exists .
the guy said sorry for the wait but he did n't mean it .
i asked them how long it would take ryan told me _num_ mins .
i said , i 'm sorry , i did n't see any signs .
this has to be the worst pizza hut location i have been to .
without complaining , i had received a coupon for a free large pizza .
so they leave you with a terrible experience every , single , time .
i paid _num_ for a no _num_ combo with a beyond small shake .
this place was filthy ... everywhere , and the food was nasty looking .
they need to teach their employees some manners and how costumer service works !
i ordered a crispy chicken classic with fries and headed back to work .
the medical doctor was unable to help me with a prescription i needed .
but do n't risk the car running out of gas to come here .
been here for about _num_ waiting & still have n't gotten my food .
not going to bother having another sent out because we 're so hungry .
ok , all done with red lobster for a good long while now .
i have went to this location over a hundred times in high school .
my food experience was just so strange and terrible at the same time .
ask for fried rice with your meal they give you chicken fried rice .
i told the lady that it was hurting and she did n't stop .
when i first walked in , i was hit with that bathroom smell .
i ca n't believe that i just paid $ _num_ for her groom .
but on the bright side they do have hot peppers as an option .
i am not sure what was worse ... the food or the employees .
there were a handful of flies waiting to greet us in our room .
the front desk never called to check if the situation had been resolved .
this place does n't even deserve the one star i 'm giving them .
this is my second trip to this place and both wee bad experiences .
i ca n't help but understand why sears is in such financial trouble .
it 's like you asked them to walk _num_ miles to get some .
the course is in even worse condition from when the pictures were taken .
the meat was like a lunch meat instead of real sliced deli beef .
it was like our couch was made from three leftover pieces they had .
my boyfriend got orange chicken and teriyaki chicken so we could share everything .
i wanted to give you zero stars but it would n't let me .
we did n't have to wait very long before our meal was delivered .
whose **** do i need to suck to get a drink around here ?
not joking _num_ freakin minutes i was in there and i was gone .
i saw them put _num_ small containers front of me and said no .
in general , this petsmart just was not a fun place to be .
lots of issues with the games not working and not giving tickets out .
too much bread ( $ ) for not enough meat ( meat ) .
it was n't horrible tasting food , just bland for what i prefer .
i have never had such terrible service , especially from management as well .
we walk up and wait a bit in line , no big deal .
there was a gentleman smoking outside creepy looking and went into the lobby .
we stay at motel _num_ a lot , but this is the worst .
the front door was broken off of the cabinet that held the fridge .
the pepper beef i found completely bizarre : the meat was almost smooth .
let me be specific as to why i do n't like this place .
if you ask after they give you your bag they get all mad .
plus he was n't very helpful with putting my car in the driveway .
i hate them for not giving me the option by calling me first .
i do n't know what happened but the crust is not the same .
i hardly doubt they reached their limit on a tuesday but who knows .
unfortunately we will never make the mistakes of going to this location again !
finally the food comes , and of course , the order is wrong .
there was no sign or anything to say i could n't park there .
other than that i do n't know who else could appreciate this place .
the problem is the management & the maintenance staff do not fix anything .
do n't waste your money here if you are looking for a meal .
she handed me the mirror and said `` what do you think ? ''
phones calls most of the times ignored , they never returned my call .
you wo n't get good sleep due to being worried about your vehicle .
it just looked like the bed had been made and that 's it .
the stink when i opened the door to my room was really awful .
i love the wings but they are n't worth the beyond terrible service .
i 'm glad i got this for such a cheap price through hotwire .
the salad was heavy on the onions , easy on the anything else .
i may shop there again - not ( unless pig 's fly ) .
i have better tacos at home using fry 's brand of taco seasoning .
it was our first time at red lobster , and probably our last .
i ran out of this place and i will never ever come back !
made an appointment to get my oil changed at 8am on june 2nd .
also the manager is racist & they do not accept section _num_ anymore .
if we had waited any longer , they all would have been dead !
she would have ignored me completely had i not called for her attention .
that 's too bad cause this is the closest sears to my house .
sat down and saw people getting seated that came in after i did .
nothing to write home about , but i 'll write it on yelp .
i sent my boyfriend within ten mins to go pick our dinner up .
my husband thought the soup was good and the egg roll was crispy .
after this experience , we 're not sure if we want to return .
windows have n't been cleaned in years you can see scum on them .
ordered the family pack which included _num_ wings , fries and garlic bread .
they were out of mushrooms , so i expected more veggies on it .
i have to say , i find the meat to be super sketchy .
promised glasses would be ready for pickup within _num_ to _num_ business days .
the place was filthy and the woman behind the counter was incredibly rude .
how else can one explain the _num_ and _num_ stars for this place ?
my hubby and i frequent this waffle house , usually late at night .
there 's reasonable room to park at least just not enough of them .
my appetizer was cold , half of the bowl of muscles were closed .
this was the most disgusting place i 've stayed in a long time .
i went to red lobster today with my family the service was horrible .
it was a thick burger smothered with salty onions , mushrooms & cheese .
i travel _num_ miles further to the peoria location which is much nicer .
food was `` meh '' , maybe i just ordered the wrong thing .
service - sketchy ... um appetizers are served before the entree not after .
the chicken was sliced , grilled , and tasted like it was microwaved .
i would rather be dirty than stay one more min in this place .
however i have two main complaints that result in such a low rating .
i ca n't imagine that they did n't give me napkins or dips .
i had to tell one of the managers but they did n't care .
the owner wo n't return calls and the staff wo n't help .
the exam was decent , but after that it was all downhill !
no way i could make it across town on a friday night .
unfortunately for the price of rent here the apartments are really dated .
( to eat , not to love , but to eat ) .
assuming that they had it on file , i didnt even ask .
if you like these fake chinese buffets , then ignore this review .
there were like _num_ or _num_ other tables in the whole place .
she says no i 'm a lead or something of that sort .
had i reviewed it i would have given it a solid _num_ .
edit : hi rick , i appreciate your desire for a resolution .
she immediately got an attitude and told me they was not cold .
the drive thru is supper dirty and the ppl there are rude !
they argued with me and gave me a lame $ _num_ credit !
the store manager told the sales guy to give me an apple .
i do not steal , do n't have to and never have .
while i was eating , a coach roach ran across my table !
we still had to wait longer than our scheduled pick up time .
this place does n't deserve any stars their customer service is horrible !
when is the last time you were here '' blah blah blah .
me and my husband went here last saturday for an early dinner .
i called the salon before purchasing the groupon to check their availability .
then , the server tried to charge me for a new ranch !
she ended up with a mild first degree burn on her stomach .
the service sucked starting from the second we walked in the door .
we found _num_ in a corner , the rest was n't cleaned .
both times the bartender was too busy to take my dinner order .
not thrilled with this place , probably wo n't come here again .
i was disappointed that our pizza did n't have that this time .
and the staff in the cafe is not the most friendly bunch .
i did n't care for the food , thought it was bland .
guess i 'll have to keep driving to tempe for taco tuesday .
she did n't greet me politely or acknowledge that i was there .
i spent $ _num_ and they want me to pay for dips .
i totally agree but the way he said it was very arrogant .
probably the least appetizing chinese food i 've had in my life .
when she took the acrylics off she left my nails completely broken .
then he had to leave and try and get my refund processed .
the egg roll , over cooked , greasy , stale and horrible !
but quite obnoxious if you are not into that type of thing .
usually , i could use my groupon right away but whatever '' .
the service was friendly but the food was not worth the money .
she said , `` they 're really busy in the back . ''
the worst experience i have ever had at a dr 's office !
she walked out and left me in there for half an hour .
it is all about up sale and scare tactics at this vet .
he stated things like i could n't afford `` quality gyms '' .
the front end did begin to drag and we told him so .
right now , _num_ '' cold cut or meatball subs are _num_ .
if the tow driver would 've helped , i would of tipped .
who does n't want to savor every minute of their lunch hour ?
there are way better places than here so please look else where .
yo yelp people - why is n't there a zero star rating ?
and food is cold , soggy , not edible by any means .
the pizza dough was good and the wings were big and fresh .
very limited choices in regards to meat , vegetables , and sauces .
it was the most rudest most disrespectful thing he could have done .
the cheese pita might be the same _num_ , close to it .
my man did n't even finish his good and that never happens .
by far one of the worst shopping experiences i 've ever had .
they would n't remove it from our bill nor offer any discounts .
i called to help one of my employees get an apartment today .
all in all , we were really disappointed and will not return .
the whole drink area was a mess as was the dining area .
they give you a short wait time , but did n't deliver .
all i could taste was extremely burnt onions and insanely soggy bun .
i only go since it is on the way home from work .
so we sat there for _num_ minutes before she even sat us .
i guess everyone is so used to their mcdonalds and microwave dinners .
now , the one advantage i thought was present , is not .
this is easily the worst motel _num_ i have ever stayed in .
my poor pup , with no teeth at only _num_ yrs old .
the server nikki was awful , the food was mediocre at best .
if this is a recipe change it is not a good one .
it simply did n't `` hit the spot '' so to speak .
with the first bite i knew it was not what i expected .
i then asked how long it would take was quoted _num_ hours .
i ca n't wait to get rid of sprint because of this !
my son had a horrible experience with the staff at this complex .
a month apart and now i am concerned about having another experience .
we waited for _num_ minutes and ended up leaving with no food .
the elevator button was missing for a bit on the third floor .
but what was n't acceptable was the salt level in the food .
they toasted my bread and popped the corned beef in the microwave .
the attitude just gets worse as you 're shopping and checking out .
they also left a greasy hand print on my light grey interior .
we walked in and the place was dirty and not well lit .
i would suggest they hire someone with more experience working with customers .
i am sad to see how much this place has gone downhill .
only reason i gave them _num_ star is because i had to .
for app , we got the stuffed mushrooms with shrimp and lobster .
i 'm only giving one star because i ca n't give zero .
but lack of integrity , i am looking somewhere else this evening .
first , the driver was super late to pick up our stuff .
then someone suggested leaving a yelp review , so here i am .
i tried a side of cole slaw and it seemed very processed .
i also asked for hot sauce , guess what i got instead ?
for that reason , i 'll likely stay away from this establishment .
i was there yesterday , and the line was nine customers deep .
other than the food which was lacking , so was the service .
they were naturally cold so we asked for something a little fresher .
when you 're passing through town , get thee to the grocery .
george is probably the only trustworthy employee in this whole entire complex .
when telling cashier , he acted like he did n't hear me .
i need to cancel my membership and ask for my money back .
_num_ and a half hours for a quoted _num_ min oil change .
the repair was made and the fridge stopped working the same night .
the dressing was thin and tasteless , very little blue cheese flavor .
so we she did get to see him but almost by force .
the rest are worthless , unreliable , and extremely rude and unprofessional !
when i arrived to pick it up they did n't have it .
very disappointment , customer service very poor and food was not good .
it a hole in the wall in the middle of crack haven .
consumer beware because the great customer service i was promised is non-existent .
could n't check the second room since our key did n't work .
said she 'd be back with it , never returned with one .
i requested a tow to coach works on a tuesday after hours .
a month later , i still had not received my dryer back .
it would have been fine or i would have went else where .
the place was dirty with screaming children running around out of control .
apparently , i was not the only one with the roach issue .
the only answer i got was prices are different after certain hours .
the non-smoking room reeked , but that was n't even the start .
she tries to upsell me on the meal , i say no .
the store is very busy from 8am to about 10pm at night .
took _num_ minutes to get our drinks and the order was wrong .
they always mess up my order and give me the wrong food .
they do n't have a separate person working the drive through window .
she did agree to adding a order of fries free of charge .
i still want my old hole in the wall lenny 's back .
first off we were treated rudely over the drive thru order radio .
i was disappointed to see the prior yelp page removed - why ?
i had never been to a texas roadhouse quite like this one .
we are late for our concert at this point and beyond frustrated .
i would not recommend this salon , nor will i be returning .
i guess i need to spell that out more clearly next time .
the only thing different is that they refilled the paper towel dispenser .
the manager was yelling at the cashier while we placed our order .
but it reminds me off chinese food prepared for a mexican clientele .
it took them two days to come out and fix my fridge .
the cashier do n't understand you and the order was messed up .
i am not sure what the big deal is about this place .
it might actually be worse than little caesar 's or peter piper .
had we had any other choices , we would have taken them .
she welcomed us and said hello as soon as we walked in .
burns in the blankets and little dead bugs on top of bed !
our waitress seemed rushed and never even came back to refill waters .
this is a corporate vet and everything bad that corporate vets do .
the office never answers their phone and does n't return any messages .
manager said i could pay more to get a synthetic o change .
save your money and get a $ _num_ hot n ' ready !
as soon as she saw me she knew why i was there .
the customer service is none the girls and the cook are rude .
maybe that 's why the inside of the restaurant was so dead .
however , now as an adult the experience was not the same .
gravy and side of corn were so salty it ruined the meal .
saw the show and came to see _num_ stars , forget it .
called in a delivery order from this location and it was late .
this is by far the worst nail salon i have been too .
we should have gotten up and walked out to go someplace else .
not to mention , they messed up on my dad 's order .
when entering , i was willing to give the techs a chance .
just got a peter piper pizza for the 1st time in awhile .
i did n't have tub , just a shower with a seat .
they need table cloths , spotless glasses , uniforms , and managing .
my husband and i were dining here for valentines day last year .
the least they could do was substitute tenders in place of breast .
i would n't trust danny 's to do anything to my truck .
another purse had been put into the dust cover in its place .
i drive back there and wait in line to return my food .
so we changed it up and guess what pizza still sucks !
spoke to a person at their office and was told sorry !
they charged for unnecessary supplies for a very poor quality service .
the exam was decent , but after that it went downhill !
worst room i have ever stayed in in my entire life .
also , most of the machines are taken all the time .
fuck this place and their lack of white chicken and corn .
she would drag on the words in a high <UNK> voice .
another incident that should n't have happened was in the bakery .
they are so busy only _num_ people working the food counter .
this place is the worst place i have ever been too .
the food is lacking quality and cost is not that great .
sorry but extremely pissed at them and will never be back !
even the manager i spoke to was n't up to par .
absolutely ridiculous , i would not recommend this location at all !
if i had a craving for egg rolls , i might .
however , i 'm not paying for any of those things .
i was disappointed with the steak fries as they were mushy .
i got one $ _num_ credit but it did n't continue .
the selection was similar to sweet tomatoes , but lower quality .
the pizza and the wings were n't all that good either .
the very nice lady behind the counter said sure no problem .
i thought walmart cashiers were bad , these take the cake !
this on the other hand was a disaster from the beginning .
take out dinner for four cost $ _num_ ... $ _num_ !
i do n't even think we 'll bother going back there .
this is just not a good way to run a business .
i seriously feel so gross right now after eating there tonight .
no eggs no green olives ect and paid almost ten dollars !
i would avoid this place as their diagnostic skills are pathetic .
yelp is my review , my story , and my life .
so they obliged and gave me another room ( pro ? )
the dough for the pizza has lost it taste and texture .
they were unprofessional , rude and extremely difficult to deal with .
first off , their lay out is all over the place .
asked to speak with he manger he too do not arrive .
they had apparently called the clubhouse to complain about our pace .
which i expected , i have been to corporate vets before .
the place looks gross , old and not clean at all .
he was extremely rude , and he hung up on me !
one of the worst animal hospitals i have ever been too !
asked for sausage egg cheese biscuit with bacon instead of sausage .
i 'm pretty sure you 'll walk out of there sick !
i had to stay outside in the hot sun of _num_ .
this place is horrible , ca n't even finish my lunch .
i generally like olive garden but this location is the worst .
you can keep your rotten tomatoes and sour salsa , jerks .
honestly , i would only leave zero stars if i could .
as of harkins goes this theater is a hit or miss .
haha could give another star for convenience but parking is bad !
i have never had a regular cleaning only take _num_ minutes .
the service was friendly and the food was n't very expensive .
the wait was reasonable , especially for brunch on a sunday .
i 'm not talking about running a few minutes late either .
that should have been washed properly , someone could get sick .
they suck , after years of going there i am done .
at that point i had it and left with no food .
i , and my friends will avoid that course for now .
shady area , even a security guard is walking the grounds .
this is the absolute worst walgreens i 've ever been to .
i have been a loyal big o customer for many years .
_num_ for mani gel they did n't charge me for removal .
to the lazy manager you lost a loyal customer over shrimp !
if i could give this place no stars , i would .
but didnt think it meant getting a _num_ % cooked pizza .
i never got a call and a repair was never made .
the coupon says it 's only good tonight at the game .
two other customers had incorrect orders at the same time too .
do not use this company at all seriously call someone else .
my cheese for my hashbrowns was n't melted , at all .
in addition to being wrong , the food was absolutely disgusting .
if it was possible i would give it a negative star .
she was yelling so loud that the entire restaurant went quiet .
last i checked _num_ minutes was _num_ hour and _num_ minutes .
and its not the first time that service was bad there .
we left at 6am cutting our _num_ night start to one .
there are _num_ sinks but only _num_ mirror in there too .
this is not something the family should have to deal with !
went through drive thru , ordered two _num_ piece chicken strips .
the fried outer layer was overcooked , over salted and smooth .
turns out the hours posted are not their hours of service .
do not get sucked into the hype of that dumb commercial .
walked in and was told there was a 10-15 minute wait .
the potatoes were cold and so was the macaroni and cheese .
several others walked in behind me also with complaints on orders .
brooklyn boys ' alfredo blows this place out of the water !
husband ordered the ribeye and it too was cooked well done .
the staff is rude , unpleasant and just a bad experience .
i really do n't get why people come here so often .
we could n't tell who worked there and who did n't .
the food was n't bad , but it did lack flavor .
do not get tamales with baja sauce ... it 's mush .
but now there 's no way i 'll ever go back .
the next room was not under construction but clearly needed repairs .
victor in the paint department never called back like he said .
the wheat bread was not very good , and too thick .
i ordered the teriyaki chicken and it was a little bland .
so , this place was perfect to just sleep and go .
the cheese was barely melted and the sauce tasted store bought .
the place did n't even do anything for the birthday girl .
there was a lot of staff there , and no customers .
we did n't see her after she dropped off our food .
the young girl that did the mani cut my nails uneven !
first , the cashier clearly did n't want to be there .
do n't go here if you want any kind of service .
really , that 's not too much to change , right ?
the crust was plain and there was a lot of it .
i did n't really care where i was going to stay .
very disappointed never going back to this ghetto restaurant is horrible !
sometimes i have to repeat no , this store in particular .
order _num_ simple things was told 30-45 min which is find .
luckily no one here cares that they serve you horrible food .
she did n't file my nails nor even clean them out .
the service was poor and the atmosphere did n't feel clean .
our waitress , andrea , was nice , though quite rushed .
_num_ minutes to get _num_ cheese burgers and a small fry .
go back and have bad service again and spend more $ ?
stand in line and get to the front but no pizza .
for the soup , i went with the chicken & gnocchi .
this means for over a month i will have no refrigerator .
we were so disappointed the chicken fried sirloin is so terrible .
unfortunately i ca n't so i have to give them one .
it did n't take long to figure out what it was .
not only is the service terrible , the management is terrible .
i assure you , i have no problem paying my way .
doctor said that i had food poisoning from poorly maintained meat .
when we received our order of wings , they were cold .
the place was crowded on monday morning ( labor day ) .
the worst experience i have ever had at an enterprise location .
the only good thing about this place is that its cheap .
to top it off the food was prepared with no gloves .
i ca n't see what other people see in this place .
$ _num_ plus tax for two people , one bowl each !
the carne was flavorless and the fries were cold and mushy .
but there came a point that i could ignore no more .
customers do n't have time to lie about a damn membership .
walked out of this place after _num_ min of no service .
i used to love olive garden but its become so blah .
i asked for _num_ queen beds and got _num_ double beds .
the point of having a _num_ hour location is for convenience .
when the food finally arrived , it was n't anything spectacular .
she then did not follow the comment up with a reason !
it took me _num_ minutes just to drive there one way .
the buildings are semi quiet , ca n't complain about that .
they need a serious remodeling and to clean this mess up .
if i could give this a negative star , i would .
i asked if i could get one from an empty room .
so i asked again for the manager and explained the situation .
if you go in make sure you do not get brian !
i declined the box and left my leftovers at the restaurant .
# _num_ missing light bulbs in the light fixtures # _num_ .
i do n't understand why they do n't do dressing either .
the decor was a lot nicer than i was expecting too .
call the front desk and request one , this is approx .
instead , they made everything so much hard and more painful .
it was hot but i noticed immediately , no pizza aroma !
this is a oil change express station with two servicing stations .
but they wo n't be getting any further business from me .
do n't come here without expecting do wait over _num_ mins .
myself and my family will not be returning to the place .
it 's very loud , unclean and humans there buy everything .
to start off i wish i could give them zero stars .
my pasta was so dry that it was almost sticking together .
why am i still surprised when companies are unethical and dishonest ?
also the shower had no hot water and no water pressure .
i am not even gon na go into prices or anything .
any chain restaurant , for that matter , has better pizza .
( point here : texas roadhouse does n't have them ) .
she did n't even realize that we already had our food .
so my wings came out _num_ mins before pizza was done .
not cuz of the hair but because of the mediocre food .
please beware they are looking for a buck at your expense !
i gave my friend money to purchase me food for lunch .
really old washers and dryers that seem to run super loudly .
i waited for _num_ minutes to open to replace my battery .
wtf i took the room and headed to 3rd floor hell .
they said the van was there but could n't find us .
so of course i am going to use the vet visit .
the greens are too hard and do n't hold approach shots .
no one should wait for what i had to wait for .
afterwards , i went about my various errands for the day .
been here for years but they can never get it right .
under it 's current management it 's a complete ripoff .
none of the _num_ employees in the kitchen acknowledged me .
only reason i gave a star was yelp forced me too
while the pizza was decent , the wings were awesome .
shame i ca n't give this place a lower review .
according to aaa , the wrong size filter was installed .
not a great selection , but cheaper than sweet tomato .
we started asking questions and he was being very rude .
i 'm pissed because good customer service would have been .
not much of the egg was noticeable in either dish .
my husband purchased some of their house made hot sausage .
so basically their guarantee is that there is no guarantee .
i paid the $ _num_ and have never been back .
it took _num_ minutes for a table to open up .
`` cafe '' could not be slower if they tried .
again in a super loud voice we were told no .
food is ok but service is something that is lacking .
there was an employee drinking beer while he was working .
it was totally bland and was overwhelmed with ricotta cheese .
food was disgusting , raw chicken , cold and soggy .
the second room was better , but still nothing spectacular .
if you like that kinda white trash thing go ahead .
if i could rate it _num_ stars , i would .
the place is worn and old looking inside and out .
informed the driver thru person and obviously did n't care .
i agree with jason b , the service here sucks !
she did n't even bother to come over my way .
i would give this place zero stars if i could .
there were extremely loud children so there 's no ambience .
if i only had know i would never moved in .
what a shame of a business you are running linda .
if i could give it zero stars , i would .
this was after i paid them to fix my pool .
i walked in and they told me they 're closed .
i would not recommend this to my friends or family .
horrible , horrible service they do n't deserve any stars .
do not spend your hard earned money at this location .
bathroom looks like it had never been cleaned , ever .
i ordered pizza hut the next time i wanted pizza .
like wtf am i going to do with cherry sauce ?
is this a race or she just hates taking orders ?
and we did n't even get chocolates with the check !
i ca n't even imagine what the kitchen looks like .
the woman owner wo n't even give me her name .
after _num_ of these i was going a little insane .
the maids left the trash in the hallways all night .
got to the room and it had a horrible odor .
did n't feel too safe to go for a walk .
it was n't terrible , but it was n't pleasant .
fortunately , there was a ross store down the street .
i ca n't understand how they 're still in business .
we drove _num_ minutes across town to <UNK> a kitten .
they lose a lot of points because of bad service .
this location does n't even come close to being awesome .
the guy in front of us was ordering in spanish .
this was the worst one i 've ever been to !
all in all ... we will not be coming back .
i have never felt so damn uncomfortable in my life !
so got off from a _num_ hour shift pretty hungry .
some of my favorite bars have been considered dive bars .
trying to get in and out is a constant challenge .
i was a little disappointed with the quality and portion .
went to sam 's club last sunday with my mom .
this woman has no business being in the hospitality industry .
spent _num_ minutes passed that to finally be attended too .
i spent almost _num_ min laughing at just _num_ jacket .
which is less than we paid for by the way .
hey we have been getting complaints that our pizza sucks .
not a good experience maybe a bad night for them ?
i would n't go here for a meal ever again .
the ice cream ( yogurt ) machine is no more .
hardly any sauces , and it 's totally ugly inside .
finally they said it 'll be ready in _num_ mins .
the meats looked like frozen , rolled up lunch meat .
as soon as you walk in the room it stinks .
it was a _num_ dollar bowl for crying out loud .
so , basically , they left me waiting for that .
second night the room was not cleaned and no towels .
wo n't return and threw away 3/4 of the pizza .
no problem , i 'll take my business somewhere else .
i was told the wait time would be _num_ minutes .
their pharmacy staff are very rude , slow and unprofessional .
there was comes a time when you make bad choices .
the sweet and sour pork , taste like chicken nuggets !
the only thing worse than the room was the staff .
thank god we left at _num_ _num_ the next morning .
for a steakhouse , some darker brews compliment the meat .
i would be embarrassed to call this my golf course .
the carrot and celery sticks are mushy and off color .
i ended up waiting almost _num_ mins which was inconvenient .
i could n't find a mirror to save my life !
why do they charge so much to use credit cards ?
i 'm not surprised this subway only has _num_ star !
_num_ star for that and another for the yummy biscuits .
i have n't been in awhile because of these reasons .
i would give this place a negative score if possible .
the tiles on the steps were cracked and missing chunks .
the hotel staff could n't have cared about anyone one .
this place sucks bad , they used to be good .
he went to prepare our food without washing his hands .
we opened the door to the room , it smelled .
as a female i am personally offended by this place .
i 've gone with my mother to buy appliances here .
no refills on drinks were offered while we were there .
dogs were wandering all over the complex without their owners .
the third order our garlic knots were burnt and hard .
drove away , got on freeway headed out of town .
is it too much to ask for a courtesy call ?
half the time they ca n't get my order right .
it 's now to the point where it 's disgusting .
do not stop here if you are wanting fast service .
i got there and they only had one _num_ pack .
i do n't like big brother hovering over my shoulder .
i do n't know how they got such good reviews .
$ _num_ for two _num_ oz steaks _num_ salad bar .
i did n't want to drink out of my glass .
( this was done a week previous to this . )
will not come back ... this place has no windows ?
i do n't care if it 's only $ _num_ .
we also pressed the button _num_ times to get someone .
the service the last time i went was just terrible .
online pick up you better be ready for long delays .
not advertised as a special , just a normal item .
but i do n't feel my vehicle is safe outside .
anyway , i saw _num_ shirt that was semi cute .
i felt bad for the owners of this arizona staple .
now i remember why i do n't like olive garden .
so me and the wife went here _num_ weeks ago .
all i ate there was crunchy rice and soy sauce .
all the _num_ star reviews are very odd to me .
i will never set foot inside another macayo 's again .
i would give this place negative stars if i could .
our wait for food was _num_ minutes -- no joke .
i washed my hands and there were no paper towels .
needless to say , i have n't been back since .
but why would i , i did n't suspect them .
yesterday on my lunch break i was craving carne fries .
needless to say we left and will not be back .
i could n't even bring myself to finish one bowl .
i took my parents and unfortunately we were very disappointed .
he did n't care that my daughter had gotten sick .
this even longer story short , they changed my oil .
do n't plan on finding quality product at low prices .
why would n't she tell me that from the beginning ?
no food ready but asked if i could pay now .
i 'm not even kidding , it was falling off .
i reserved a room with _num_ double beds no smoking .
any other store , one could request a price check .
it did n't ring up so the cashier called someone .
_num_ minutes after ordering : grills broken , no hotdogs .
i wish i 'd gone to the big apple instead .
i ordered them with no guacamole , add extra cheese .
the past _num_ years they have really gone down hill .
it was really disgusting , so i contacted my manager .
the sandwich was dressed with a not so tasty dressing .
i really expected so much more but was completely disappointed .
the fiesta potatoes are never cooked all the way through .
i do n't know , though , just my opinion .
there was hardly any ice cream at all in mine .
having to wait a long time for just my drink .
unfortunately eating some taco bell would be a better choice .
i 'm usually a big fan of olive garden .
i did n't have to give you a dime .
so i was a little disappointed at this point .
had n't been to this place in _num_ years .
do not trust these people , and also rude .
i probably wo n't be back for another _num_ .
does n't offer and soy sauce or anything else .
the manager was nice enough - no big deal .
that was the only good thing about this place .
she rings me up and hands me one cup .
the toilet in the room did n't stop running .
save your money and do n't buy a warranty !
no paper towels anywhere in gas fill up area .
the pizza came more quickly than we had anticipated !
we picked _num_ cities to stop in while driving .
not like they 're doing the work for free !
the people working seemed very confused making my sandwich .
it looks like someone 's already eaten it ! ''
i could n't even eat part of my meal .
you really ca n't go wrong with fried shrimp .
meat sitting around at room temperature in plain view .
well that 's a load of horse $ h !
it has not been the same on several occasions .
this is a warning : do n't go there !
i took one bite and could n't eat anymore .
so disappointed , most likely wo n't be returning .
he did not even bother requesting a price check .
i just spent _num_ days throwing up , diarrhea .
there were bad grapes mixed in with good ones .
the restroom had no toilet paper or hand soap .
when i checked my order the fries were cold .
i will not <UNK> from them any longer either .
no problem with the actual care at the facility .
i 've had nothing but bad experiences with then .
diner beware : it will go down under quickly .
walk up menu and salsa bar for lunch only .
which made me just lose my appetite all together !
could n't get out of the there fast enough .
that is to say , service was totally non-existent .
there 's no chance i will ever be back .
also they do not have gluten free soy sauce .
our _num_ month old had bed bugs on her .
unfortunately i will not be eating here again ... .
it makes me never want to buy furniture again .
if i could give them a zero i would .
but she said unfortunately they had no more sauce ?
i clearly ordered the special when i walked in .
i do n't know how else to put it .
i wo n't be ordering pizza from here again .
they really need a waitress to run the floor .
she had no compassion during a time of loss .
not recommended just go to walmart or somewhere else .
i love kfc , but this location is horrible .
i keep trying to give this place a chance .
i am glad we only stayed one night here .
even the frozen yogurt did n't taste very good .
i got done what i needed to get done .
wo n't go back to this waffle house again .
tasted like they put tons of salt on it .
i would not recommend this place to anyone ever .
if i could give it a _num_ i would .
of my entree , only the salad was great !
where i come from they skate , not here .
do n't ever ever ever stay at this hotel .
at least this _num_ minute wait wont end badly .
my tow assistance is set by progressive at 10am .
ultimately , it felt like being in a factory .
she brought me my drink , minus the straw .
avoid coming here if you do n't have to .
my husband has had problems with this location too .
the sight of the food was just completely unappealing .
the tired bartenders are over worked and under staffed .
this hotel was the worst hotel we stayed in .
but i should have gone to a real salon .
we get back home and the order was wrong .
the service was nice but not worth coming back .
left them a voicemail and never returned my call .
i went in as a guest no fee charged .
waited _num_ minutes for breakfast at 10:30 this morning .
very unimpressed and wo n't be coming back again .
never again will i go back to this restaurant .
do n't eat the pizza , or hang out .
so , his arrival did n't help the problem .
after they hook you , they do n't care .
customer service _num_ : never argue with a customer !
i would n't refer anyone to use this company .
they make me feel uncomfortable to shop for wigs .
it 's ghetto and the service is incredibly horrible .
the comforter looked _num_ years old and had holes !
they lost a sale and customer for being cheap .
do n't know ... do n't want to know .
this last trip may have been the breaking point .
stay as far away from this place as possible .
he does not know how to operate the business .
if i could give negative rating omg i would .
to add to that , they are super slow !
it 's the worst pizza i 've ever had .
looked at the bottom of container barely any sauce .
only wish i could have given them _num_ stars .
cold potato , the cheese would n't even melt .
why are the fast food chains always so busy ?
the food was cold and did not meet expectations .
i wish i could give this place negative stars .
i just had a horrible experience with this location .
it 's not hard to find , i swear .
the stations were messy and they were short staffed .
you should do your best to avoid this wal-mart .
the restrooms did n't work , toilet paper everywhere .
as writing this still stuck in the drive thru .
it was pretty odd for an almost empty restaurant .
the star is for me and my seasoning additions !
unfortunately we had o option then to stay there .
the equipment they had was really outdated and painful .
went to get my dogs nails trimmed and bath .
there was no taste to the food at all .
for the price , i did n't expect much .
_num_ hour wait just for them to bullshit us !
went tonight on a recognition and was horribly disappointed .
i will not be coming back to this one .
it 's just not an enjoyable place to play .
overall , it 's a typical chinese american restaurant .
outside smells _num_ times better than my room did .
not really i heard you talking about your relationship .
i did n't believe them like i stated above .
this place is for the cheap and dirty sort .
terrible customer service , staff arguing with each other .
it had very little sauce and very little cheese .
almost like a smokey smell mixed with bad bo .
totally inappropriate for any family restaurant in my opinion .
i would n't recommend this stupid place at all !
stopped by for a local , fire grilled burger .
overall , i was not impressed and regret going .
no toppings , just soft serve vanilla ice cream .
i will be contacting groupon to get a refund .
ca n't even supply their shoppers with shopping carts .
whatever you can imagine being bad ... it is .
it added unfortunate stress to an already stressful day .
unfortunately it 's the closest one to our house .
i really do n't know if it was water .
even my brother did n't want to finish them .
and another _num_ mins just to get our check .
the entire visit lasted two and a half hours .
this restaurant does not know how to make them .
will not be back ever and filed a complaint !
the waitress then offered to refill our bread basket .
first impression : the place is really really dirty .
i wanted to like it , i really did .
they are never apologetic for this by the way .
i 'll spend my money where it 's welcome .
so for _num_ , i would skip this place !
but i have to get this off my chest .
which is pretty sad since it 's for children .
the sheets , comforter , and towels were stained .
no , just the regular oil change , thanks .
my pillow case had a burned hole in it .
this is the worst excuse for italian food ever .
still ca n't beat a $ _num_ foot long .
this gym i way over do for an upgrade .
the waiter would disappear and hardly checked on us .
abandoned motel next door with its windows busted out .
if you do n't you wo n't get any .
it is tolerable maybe once but not four times .
probably the worst olive garden i have been to .
maybe i am just visiting at the wrong time .
there where _num_ waiters , still service was slow .
the cheese is different , the crust is different .
i would recommend not going to this place ever !
the food has never been much more than convenient .
let alone the store manager was snotty and rude !
the rest of the food items were just gross .
i was blatantly ignored and when i asked again .
the greeter when you walk in does n't smile .
it has n't been for quite a few years .
several trays were empty , and were not refilled .
i left my purchases there along with another customer .
the place was n't even busy at this time .
it sure was quick , but , come on !
i had to get off freeway and return them .
do not order from here they are the worst !
they were a soggy , greasy , tasteless mess .
horrible customer service and very rude front desk lady .
they are not compassionate or understanding to my condition .
may i recommend the apricot chicken or mixed grill ?
had a terrible meal here from start to finish .
service was a bit slow and not that friendly .
will never play here again after playing here today .
do n't even hang out in the parking lot .
my son 's smothered steak was da bomb !
really disappointed with the service at this location .
they do n't take care of their comics .
the deli and prepared food area smells bad .
spent money on crappy food and horrible service !
this is the inventory that no one wanted .
it was a little rude and off putting .
i will never come to this restaurant again .
employees were overly rude , inconsiderate and unprofessional .
she was too confused to answer my question .
food arrives , everything is normal , whatever .
i did n't like his service at all .
if i could rate a zero i would .
( he was under a year old ) .
will not be coming back to this location .
i asked why he was being so rude .
denise did n't remember ever speaking with me .
the sandwich was greasy and tasted like chemicals .
food was so bad we left without eating .
if i could i would give _num_ stars .
i am so disappointed , i feel cheated .
however i am not satisfied with this place .
that was going to cost me $ _num_ .
i ordered a large pepperoni for $ _num_ .
i was left with seafood salad and coleslaw .
i would give this _num_ stars if possible .
i showed approved and then showed printing receipt .
never again after that have i ate there .
ingredients were of low quality with no taste .
