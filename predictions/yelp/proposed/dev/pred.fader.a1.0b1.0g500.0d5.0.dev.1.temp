by far the worst experience experience i 've ever had in my life .
i was so impressed to find a place that shop with a friendly of coffee .
very attentive and friendly ... definitely too many to return to buy your meal .
very little , see the place has the best service in the area .
i called up a few minutes after waiting and an hour got another car .
if you care for us your order - your home or from them .
called them this place looked to find an awesome for any other .
even with it had a lot with a huge , what was one 's favorite .
i have to love the wine selection , but they love the food sandwiches .
when he had to make someone there 's two hours for over _num_ minutes for dinner .
my husband and i went to and went here , then the whole manager .
very so many stars he will give them if she gave me this place .
it was easy to see this location is where i 'm in the price .
even when they 're there to be honest to get some of their food .
stop time here because you 'll have dinner for dinner for a meal back .
i asked for a car to go for a quick salad and dinner .
i 've eaten at home a day , it 's to the there .
she was so happy though that friendly when we need and just more food .
i will definitely come back to have gone , who have gone or recommend .
i was told that i would have to wait a long for dinner .
she was not a fan of the meat she had cheese and the fries .
my friend who works is different , we do n't have a nice choice .
i found my wife and he had a new fan with a `` up '' .
this place was very friendly and i was going to my last $ _num_ .
i 've had better better than this bar store and 've been in vegas .
we did n't wait happy hour and got our table of _num_ % .
do n't go back , maybe what i 've ever for it is .
no , no more options , go out , no one , which were amazing .
this place does n't give any one person the $ _num_ for one got .
here , this is fantastic , parking is super sweet to a little or easy .
me $ _num_ there change me for something me feel if you need me .
some people who and its sure they have a better experience than the whole place !
no one really want to go there or a couple of great reviews .
i went in to have a couple in phoenix who will use your car .
be sure on the phone or he ca n't even get away from them .
if you do n't know what well worth there for a long time .
i if you ca n't do anything that you get a local every time .
they do n't bring my order ( _num_ ) went up in _num_ .
next time so i did not like to it and up in that i tried .
they have getting getting many things but they give this place for $ _num_ .
a new place with an old , lots of fresh and make you feel order .
i had _num_ minutes to make it to anyone as they use his company .
a little more than your car and most much than this place is going .
some of the people do n't seem good to use a customer service .
it 's very friendly everyone to see you need my business for a decent visit .
we left was fun and the whole place looked out from getting us .
after _num_ minutes _num_ minutes was amazing but that was amazing and pretty amazing .
if i have found to this company because i can try this one .
the server that did my nails did not even put a lot of an hour .
she was extremely fast , even if they need us or at my table .
the bread was excellent , delicious and were $ _num_ at all costs .
which is also a good place i would never go to be back .
we stopped by the phone car wash and found someone else in his office .
the after my food done to order the food , our drinks were old .
overall would never visit this store and was so impressed to you me .
i 'm disappointed to say i 'll be going for a one star for breakfast .
the a thing of a great selection that gets a better than the one .
thanks ... really fresh ... , especially & people at best family staff .
i came to for a side of but were so good i get the same .
not good location are friendly but you need to any other time ever ?
i only `` more good , which i 'm going here in madison !
i love their food and was fantastic and made chicken with lots of rice .
thanks for the friendly and the owner is a great variety of your job in !
i asked for a big fan and an hour server , after _num_ % service .
it had only been a few times so it was almost two hours .
the server that was extremely professional and did n't seem to make an hour care .
my wife and i enjoyed the hot sauce that special sauce for sauce .
i will say , everyone will have ever been returning here any shop !
customer service even great about $ _num_ could be on a saturday night .
first time when i 'm the best part is the lot of fun i 'm a fan .
overall , i think there are much better places to eat in the area .
you get what you pay for sushi to go here from time to go .
there were wonderful great work on the store and this time was rude !
food was also , i had a sweet and salsa were fresh and cooked wings .
i went to find this was such and the service there to get _num_ .
needless to say we 'll go too on a great price to find .
the food is not all very nice and the wait , are extremely huge .
i took my _num_ year old steak her car last week before _num_ years ago .
and fresh ingredients did not have been cooked great and just put out .
when we got the food before we had an appointment and tasted any other .
the service was slow and they always been these guys or any food .
i really do n't love this place since i will definitely love them here .
staff was really friendly , super clean - great and staff was by far .
go with for lunch from a friendly and go to the `` that i 've had .
at the very best thing it should have been for some _num_ years .
my favorite review in a lot and one came on a saturday night .
now this is a must be a large fan and such a little family to experience .
so of my favorite experience i would do to say this i will never go !
got the order from another _num_ minutes before they got the table to our table .
their new beef , the chicken selection of `` it 's been fantastic .
we waited _num_ minutes before new days before they call me before being .
worst experience of my life , i will get my car back .
i was for the salsa on the menu , especially the $ _num_ % .
i was there as just as long as i was in the area .
for some of my wife had some top notch had the same experience .
it did not taste here , just more than just an amazing one .
which , we 've i was really to wait i will be back to her pizza .
the fish and has a excellent selection style , especially , and tasty .
my favorite one of two small , few times to go with it .
the server was told me it comes the other day and it was pretty good .
then we waited $ _num_ for a our party , which was more made .
i tried to mention and the bread did n't seem how they did .
took all of the new things and the only reason to get in the area .
they do have a few times in some way to their own what i could have .
make sure you have to visit and my favorite thing on my home favorite !
i had the egg rolls , and cheese , salad and the cheese sandwich .
this is the best time in a will , i will not be returning !
so he got a lot of it had any chicken and cheese shrimp .
so he went to my nails still asked and check for the next time .
after the worst service since i have to bring them to see the store .
i do n't want to see any care of them in any other time .
this hotel i have had the best office and have had in pittsburgh and service .
overall , i feel like family with any way in a few years ago .
i , with friends , a whole restaurant from any other friends .
i got the office restaurant was an absolute great shop and has a second time .
the meat is tasty , and does n't seem like food with free .
another _num_ minutes back my car we 'll get me _num_ % later .
the service was average but the price 's only is a great place for an hour .
i highly recommend that these people have been going here for a different family .
but 's fresh at a restaurant & with lots of beer and went with pizza .
when i called the place , i 'm pretty sure that the whole restaurant .
got a few minutes , i would give this a few weeks from its some .
i called them to even have some more than the beer at any stars .
i will not recommend anyone to anyone to this place or lots of their own .
not the best chinese food will be so bad , and it 's pretty expensive !
we went up on our waitress even from him and walked out .
the customer service that i had here , with any any restaurant on top .
unfortunately , the owner , which is almost _num_ also on the menu .
i 'd give the whole business on what they have been to my hair done .
you 're not going to find any of that 's pretty much of customer .
the service is wonderful and the servers who have great `` or rice '' .
but the guys do an amazing experience for our table to , for our table .
_num_ minutes later we got something to say , just get my business here .
it is that `` so far that they get to make how much are good !
the next time , we found the one that came would be an honest .
i also enjoyed that he was really and have no flavor and has no chicken .
i had to get _num_ stars because , i will give this review !
plus on the side of the items so far out their salsa and salsa .
if i come to visit to see this restaurant i will be going here .
this is one of the worst chinese food i 've ever had to have .
oh , and extremely cool portions are simply good for their real thing .
ordered a good dinner and it had been to even after a _num_ times .
she always get the same thing out the chicken , and beer is awesome !
i asked if she could use the meal and i would get a problem .
the `` soup is actually a great time to get what they have done .
i had it to another location and got my car in my life .
my husband and i came here , which they had any day in the future .
my husband is awesome , more than a 's pizza is so many .
every time i get back from the office , i found the restaurant area .
we will be so many of your friends to anyone and have found great .
i 'm not sure the food but extremely a wonderful and it was a horrible price .
both i had him i went out for an appetizer which i was a huge .
so in vegas , this store ... just do , do n't be .
every time i had great sushi and he 's wings ... always so sweet .
wings , two tables , my wife and then they were all delicious .
these guys have much better than a delicious , which we were looking .
needless to say , all we received quick and got a lot of food .
my wife , i feel , tried on top notch on the menu .
i have to say it 's the worst worst thai experience in this area .
i called it her or he did n't care i 've been going to them .
this place was a little pricey and a very more than `` no or her .
the service was very very very very very busy and a bit of us .
i 'm sure customer service with beer and give it in a long time !
i would n't want a lot on a great even let me care .
unfortunately , i am not happy with the experience they go to experience every day .
other pizza always can get drinks and will be from their work from them .
my wife was salad , had such and no was great to them .
they took us and they took us and did n't want a really sweet to anyone .
they did not care any friendly office because i am they are disappointed .
a friend recommended this shop he gave me _num_ , and each one .
i went back the coming with another night as well , we went here .
this would have been the first time to the counter you need to him .
but if she said , she had me to the other dishes .
but i am not sure the other people in a real are different .
also , authentic , `` , which , and the other will continue .
needless to say , i would recommend this place to anyone who ever !
it was only two or one night , but a little an
any place was not the even easy to even take one or time .
we were sorry , we had no customer service to another friendly night .
the employees were very clean and the staff was so helpful and i walked .
i 'm a very professional who does an old job of his car back .
tried to make anyone and i highly recommend to see my car .
of course , i called him and they did not bring me care .
to be the only thing that the service was really good and the sauce .
there are many years and i had a fan of this company .
it 's a great place to give this one the employees .
when she work to you order i 've got she and gave us .
then they did not have the phone and the owner for being !
this is my absolute favorite but he had me my hair by `` clean .
good service on the bar , and the most of you are not impressed .
i eat and each time and a good time and asked a lot .
i tried his customers and it comes in the future and got .
that you feel like they are you want to see what you are .
when she took our order she loved our day and it 's right .
however , well , pretty one of this restaurant in my opinion .
i got like a great and they had some different sauce .
but every , i enjoyed it so we got our and got .
this location is always clean and is fun , just kind of used .
i can see the because i think because you can be happy hour .
it seems wonderful and honest , then and do no business to them !
the good pizza and it has amazing and their customer service ( their customers .
a little over a new favorite store ... never recommended this place .
they take friendly and do n't know how to deal with the place !
this place has a full of breakfast , just , and dirty .
in a great with your make sure highly recommend them to be honest .
he was wonderful he came back , so he 's easy so nice .
this location just a great place to make more that is not very helpful .
the manager who has me to eat there is how good i have went !
another _num_ minutes later and got it was so very attentive and attentive .
i feel like than a small like would give them me a more !
i got chicken the steak and pork pork with me for $ _num_ .
was in the area and i 'd recommend this spot for a while .
i recommend with any , even service another night but an excellent .
did n't hot and drink food , coffee is pretty decent , too .
my salad was and my shrimp 's had a little sweet , he had .
as well only the one of the whole place to get in town .
no problem , service is awesome and there will be on any table .
i had to the entire day and the steak lot of cheese and never !
i do n't know this place there who will not recommend it to anyone .
we waited _num_ minutes we were not even any water or anything .
also , she said the have a good came out with a new out !
and she has the best cheese that there 's `` that '' '' .
it took us about _num_ minutes to get the extra on the table .
why must if you are looking to be told your appointment to your own !
the waiter did the look they charge is perfect and on a will be clean .
two stars is amazing - wings and there are some more days .
i have never had to have a lot in long wait for years .
overall the owner who said the `` back '' in front of me !
the food looked special , the meat itself , it just looked pretty good .
she 's hard to the new hotel with just because of delicious ... .
had no service it was awesome and tasty , i 've walked in .
first was outstanding , great my wife ordered her food that was great .
so i do not recommend this location they 're really a sweet honest .
i thought the new office has been too long for over _num_ hours .
i took them and they come and he will tell me you pay .
i do n't know what it was full than the horrible or horrible .
the server seemed impressed for the first - but i do n't recommend it .
i asked them so many stars i really got _num_ hours later .
i said , i 'm sorry , i did n't see any stars .
this has to be the best thai food i 've been in to have .
look forward i was very pleased a lot for a quick dinner , awesome .
so they are a great experience for any visit , especially , friends .
i paid _num_ for a _num_ minutes a new dinner and an old .
this place was absolutely ok , but service is , and the best food .
they have some care to make their new tea and delicious than any restaurant !
i ordered a chicken burger with fries and loved and coming back .
the guy seems to have her shop to a lot of my nails .
but do n't have the big care of me to come here .
been here for an hour and they still do n't have my order .
not going to keep going down after so i 'm sure so .
- food with some drinks selection and a lot for much better than a new .
i have been to get a great meal in any other thai .
our food was so friendly and really asked for the whole time .
huge selection and your whole experience from their love these guys .
i told the server that it was n't pleasant and she did .
when i ate home and i was impressed on the side sauce .
i ca n't know what i went , _num_ % for some sauce .
but on the old they are really nice enough than it 's been .
i am not sure what was real cheap , but the food .
there were a nice `` lot of us to come back with my friends .
the waitress who took us to be found the night had been pretty .
this place does n't even one of the best they give me in phoenix .
this is my second visit to this location and the new experience are spot .
i ca n't care but why is such in phoenix and definitely stars .
it 's like you 'd go out to get your own to get some .
the owner is right from by some customers when it was the same .
the meat was a good night of wine selection some different sauce .
it was like our made great store made us from very we received .
my friend got chicken and chicken wings so we were told how we ordered .
i wanted to give this business if it was n't sure me .
we did n't have to come to order a few times before .
these guys i do to get a lot to get home from here ?
not that we go back and i had this is in to say .
i gave them a new old salad and make me of which .
in fact , it 's really good place to be a visit .
lots of the old dining place to make up nice and extremely helpful .
too much fresh ( on fresh ) to be fresh ) meat .
it was n't horrible food , just management and what you want .
i have never had such terrible service , especially from here because .
we are away in for a new and a little bit out of too .
there was a little an old wine 's old and usually the back .
we 've been at a week for _num_ , i was as well .
the waitress came off the lot of the sauce that great .
the only flavor i got pretty good chicken which was the perfect inside .
let me be going to be that friendly are so much to this place .
if you care about me you get this company always care .
he does n't very friendly and my family from coming with a great time .
i 'll recommend you to see the an appointment who by me down .
i do n't know what happened but the place is not the same .
i love their server they serve on the new and he does not care .
once we did n't make sure the whole time i went to go !
then the food and said , of course , and the owner .
there was no big enough to say but i will n't be returning .
other than that they are so kind who will say this place .
the owner is the most professional and the most honest staff really care .
do n't waste your money here if you are looking for a price .
she makes my hair and the `` `` '' '' , you do ?
most many other service , the most dishes i would never get my money .
you are horrible a customer friendly are going to see your business .
it just looked like it had an attitude and was about it .
the when i ate my food on my wife was the car was horrible .
i love the wings but they are a wonderful business all customer .
i 'm i got this place for a few large price or customer .
the salad was perfectly on the side , even the other thing .
i love them again - really kind :
i have better options from here hands down 's sandwich and cheese .
it was our first time at phoenix , and he left any time .
i am in one of this location and will never be coming back !
made an appointment to get my son from all on a friendly night .
also the staff is incredibly professional and they only make me back that .
if we got a few other reviews , they would have been wonderful !
she would have never seen me very i 'm a regular next day .
that 's too bad this place is very close to my husband .
big & or his people working when i came in our table to order .
nothing to write home about but i , but you can get it .
i found my friends look going to go here before a few friends .
my husband said the soup was good and the crust was decent and delicious .
after our experience , i will not return how to do any time .
have n't been coming in your way from you can pay out one .
ordered the two amazing dishes , almost two dishes , and spicy beef .
they were out of , so i could find more to make that .
i have to say , the inside is very clean to find great .
has an new '' place to be _num_ or your time one time .
the place was above and the meat the manager was very rude .
how can say this one of the _num_ and _num_ stars for this place !
my wife and i ordered this dish , which has better than time .
there 's old place too , not going to see what we get .
my chicken was dry , over the top of cheese , i had cheese .
this was the best part i 've been in a long time .
i went to pick her family with my friends and the experience was great .
it was a really solid with fried rice , and reasonably priced beef .
i called _num_ minutes to see the location which is pretty new as .
food was `` '' '' , which is no one up the right .
service - ... new prices are actually busy the place was over the inside .
the chicken was delicious , and tasted like , and it was pretty good .
i would be returning a little high spot for two stars in this place .
all i 'm told my hair favorite than a bar in phoenix .
i ca n't know that they would have or her so more .
i had to see one of the server but they did n't care .
the owner wo n't return and the service is extremely professional .
the food was decent , but that was our food there though !
no way i am just having a few years for a special night .
for course , the worst customer service is always really nice .
( to eat , not to mention , but always is helpful .
however it was about the very `` and not asked that '' .
if you like these chinese food or let me give this pizza .
there were n't some long _num_ minutes for dinner a sandwich in the restaurant .
she said they have a lot of fresh what of us .
had i 've found it would have no _num_ stars a month .
: : these , i found your money for a great price .
she made an appointment back and he said that was very sad .
the front desk is clean and the guy and there are rude !
they with us and me a new $ _num_ % a lot !
the manager being manager has the car would recommend to give your own .
i do not know do n't have to do a great time .
today i was able , this little a couple of our new would visit !
we got to order a new rude off my car and money .
this place does n't give any other their customer service is awesome !
when i love the time i will have new food 's extremely huge .
and my wife and got here an appointment for dinner last night .
i called the entire steak before it on my new favorite .
then , the server seem to make a new for me !
she 's very perfect with a few more than our waitress went .
the service here gets from the front desk i went in the door .
we 've a few in a party , the manager was so .
both the service came too , very easy to go over my day .
not recommend , the store - will never be back here again .
i was our experience that everything was n't it this place .
and the staff in the place is also not the most friendly .
i did n't care for the food , it was tasty .
people who i have to keep going to be ordered 's or .
she did n't seem me feel but that came to me .
i 'd waste and you want me to pay for a new fan .
i 'm happy about the but he said it was very good .
probably the best chinese food we 've had in my life .
when she took the whole day that he had us back .
we did a few times and always a new time and my wife .
the egg rolls , over cooked , hot and salsa was awesome !
but quite good if you are not any of their way items .
however , i highly recommend my friend for his fried wings ) .
the service was friendly but the food was not worth the money .
she said , they do really know what in the back !
the worst experience i have ever had a place from me !
she walked out and came in there on a new every hour .
it is all about up and will keep the store to customer service .
he looked like everyone is really that makes you 're hot coffee .
the front desk did great or we went to what he came .
now , some of these drinks make chips and _num_ dollars .
if the only great server , will not return of i .
does n't have any time so you walk in some of their pizza ?
there are much better than going here if you should need more .
these people who are more to this is what a new problem ?
and food is fast , not even clean , any one time .
the pizza was amazing , the menu was fresh and warm and tasty .
very easy menu in need to eat , and cheese , etc .
it was the most most italian thing we could have done down .
the cheese ) have a better choice and the price i would .
my wife did n't even make it and feel like i enjoyed her .
by far one of the worst chinese restaurants i 've ever had .
they would n't recommend it that comes from her without another he .
i called to see the first to go back some family .
all in all , we were really disappointed and will not return .
the whole dinner has a great selection was the best though .
they give you a long time ... and did not care .
all i 've had extremely sweet and made any sweet and huge .
i only eat it for a special i find home from the wait time .
we went there for two minutes and my wife then her care .
i guess everyone is so hard to their clean and her definitely .
now that the one of the only location , i was just impressed .
this is the worst best part i have ever had in phoenix .
my first time , very tasty at a new family owned night .
the server was wonderful , the food was mediocre at best .
if this is a bit pricey it is a good one .
it 's completely rude it 's one big to be hot .
with the first reason i had it because i really liked it .
i asked now eating there , no one came back _num_ .
i ca n't wait to get sushi of the way of this place !
my wife had a great experience with the service at this store .
a few weeks and now i am sure about another whole experience .
we waited _num_ for _num_ minutes and got up very well experience .
the server itself is great , for a bit on the menu .
but , it was just the problem was in the quality of it .
they offer the sauce and the cheese comes in the city .
the waiter does n't look good especially when i called on them .
they also got a local nice took one and still one came .
we walked in and the place was clean and well not clean .
i would highly recommend she made to stop with more dining experience .
i am so sad to see how this place has been any good .
only i gave them _num_ stars because i am in a friendly .
for everyone , we got the perfect bread with shrimp and shrimp .
i 'm only one star because i 'd give you would leave .
but many of course , i will continue if they use this store .
first , the waitress was super busy to come from our wedding .
then gave us a new little place for everyone , so we had .
i tried a lot of thai but a great and they 've had .
i am so fresh of sweet , how hard that is doing ?
for that , we 'll get something else from this store .
i was there twice , and the waiter was perfect & more .
other than the food was delicious and so was not the atmosphere .
they were their server so happy , so i 'm an appointment .
when you 're through these guys , get a good time i got .
: is not only the new nail this place in phoenix valley .
when they called on he did not know what we got up .
i had to bring my friends and get to $ _num_ for my money .
and _num_ hours with a $ _num_ for a new oil change .
the waitress was very flavorful and the manager makes the whole menu items .
the rice was huge and was tasty , very little hot sauce .
we do it again after just getting us by or two .
the guys are our favorite , sweet and extremely , and rude !
when i come to the manager they have n't had it to anyone .
very reasonable , great service with no price and not good food .
it a few in the great of the store in one were nice .
oh because the great customer service i had is great , ever .
we could give the entire day , our waitress did n't recommend them .
she said this guy is excellent and not our experience at your time .
i 'm a few times to be an on night on my table .
a few later , i still had not my whole car back .
it would have been such to make it will see me again .
the place was clean with someone from front desk out of me .
and i thought i would not the best one with the only one .
the only thing i had was super sweet or never around any .
the front desk staff , but he was n't even the place .
she did me to find a nice of that , i do .
the store is very cool from to any friendly at night .
took _num_ minutes to get our order and the bill was wrong .
they always get me up my order for a few minutes .
they do n't have a lot person who the same thing through .
she did n't seem to get a kind of free rolls .
i still found over my money in the entire 's back .
first time we were completely surprised by the old other day .
i was very impressed by this little local shop or ?
i had never been to a little n't even any one at the counter .
we are happy for our server at this location for dinner .
i would not recommend this place next will i will be returning .
i guess i have to order that or take me away away .
the only thing i can is that they have the perfect one - loved .
the manager was at the front desk was so all my order .
but it makes me care about this bar for a decent price .
it took them another new and got to check out of it .
the do n't make sure i work with the and up she was .
i am not sure what the big deal is about this place .
it should be cool little store than a big or let 's friendly .
we had great experience today , we would n't recommend this company .
she brought us and made anything on both and have never been in .
in fact the office and such a little huge of course of !
our waitress did very helpful and made to come back another location .
this is a friendly & my first meal , really enjoyed their way .
the employees who works his service and does n't any any job .
manager said i could wait out to give a few times for sure .
save your money and get a $ _num_ hour later hot !
as soon as she said she told me there is i was them .
the customer service is the most and the portions are rude .
what does that you order and the place was so much .
however , so far the whole place was the server at the table .
and cheese staff , which was so fast they get the drinks .
the servers look to and my new favorite , if it was awesome .
walked in with a few times from here and it was great .
this is by far the best experience i 've been here .
we should have up up and walked out to go into her .
very friendly , they have on my wife and from the next day .
when i arrived , i was going to the whole place .
just got a few other good pizza in the neighborhood for years .
i did n't have good , just a fan with a smile .
they need different service , `` '' , clean , and `` '' .
my husband and i were here for such this meal away again .
the server we really said they will be returning with a lot of restaurant .
i would n't recommend these guys , do to have my experience .
another car had the only have little best in the neighborhood valley .

needless to a place i recommend when and was big !
they 're well priced for a quick service but excellent .
the food was decent , but our waiter was so fast !

however , i 'm not sure for any of those things .
i was very impressed with the front desk were always up .

the bartenders are top notch , ca n't even any of it .
they offer a nice job and a great deal up in .
if i could give this a try star , i would .
i asked if i could get a better day every week .
so i asked for him and the manager is very impressed .
if you get your new place its always make me !
i ordered the salon and left my favorite place at the restaurant .

unfortunately , they made great either so much for us and salsa .

she did n't even say that we had our food had .
so i got there _num_ times before _num_ times was done .
not nice but the hotel of course but the food is terrible .
please keep up being good for a 's worth every time !
i gave my car to make more good for lunch .
really old and cool feel and like a friendly family owned .
i waited for _num_ minutes to get to another my location .
i thought the manager and i recommend to leave or recommend .
they said the food was n't there is something me wrong .
so of course i do to find this hotel a visit .
the servers are too hard and do n't need to their new really .
no one should wait for it to be out of .
and i feel that they took my favorite for the work .
been here for years but they do an amazing taste .
it 's such many stars it 's a lot .
none of the _num_ people in a few months of me .
only reason i would say _num_ of a different car
pizza was the best , which was amazing , too .
if you say they give this place a lot .
easy to mention , the even fish was excellent .
not a great selection , but wine or fried pizza .
we both enjoyed him and he was very professional .
i 'm good looking service if this really great job .
not much of the sandwich was so in vegas sandwich .
my husband loves their cheese that made home feel tasty .
so far their pizza is so my favorite is n't amazing .
i paid the $ _num_ and have never been back .
it took _num_ minutes for a night to be away .
`` `` '' '' would be friendly if they 're .

food is ok but food is mediocre that is average .
there was an amazing dish from her office was fine .
it was fresh and made was excellent and full of rice .
food was decent , top notch , and cold .
the room was terrible , but left that way out .
if you like that should make your breakfast spot .
if i could give it _num_ stars , i would .
the place is clean and old ( in or out .
the owners person the entire staff and did n't care .
i ordered with friends , the service , great service !

my food was pleasant and i went back to my friends .
i walked in and they make me feel they 're .

after _num_ of i will not be a fan fan .
the waiter left the great in the last family owned .
got a meal and the food had a really great job .
did n't feel too much to go for a while .
it was n't bad but it was n't pleasant .
overall , there was a real store from the bill .
i ca n't understand how they 're going in business .
we waited _num_ years ago to be a fan .
they need a lot of place or lots of service .
this location does n't even look going to be done .
the office in front of us was in madison .
this was the worst one i 've ever been to !
all in all ... we will definitely be back to visit .
i have never eaten so far in my life !
so got off a from _num_ mins can be excellent .
some of my favorite have been found in phoenix also .
hard to get in and out is a bit of there .
i was a little experience with the quality and wine .

let me care of my wife just too much .
i called away away from here , just _num_ hours .
but i 've paid asked so i 'm over for the business .
everyone has always been our server , my favorite pizza .

the _num_ hours they have been really surprised down .
it was really just okay , i would recommend my meal .
the sandwich was perfect with a very little so fresh .
i really enjoyed so much more but such was extremely friendly .
the rooms are extremely old all my nails done at all .
i do n't know , though , just my wife .

unfortunately every thing they used a great spot for one .
i 'm very big $ _num_ with its definitely .
i did n't have to give you a _num_ .
so i was a little experience at this point .
had n't been to this place in _num_ years .
do not use these people , and they 're too .
i probably wo n't be back for _num_ hours .
really delicious and gave us or anything than her .
the manager was nice too - now hot .
that was the only good thing about this place .
she made me and thank me what a big fan .
the back in the room did n't help me .
thank you for money and do a have my money !
no thanks from his job in madison by far .
the pizza came more than we had got !
we waited _num_ mins to come in phoenix area .
not like they do the same work for the right !
the employees seemed very happy i had my first time .
it does like this store - `` it !
i could n't even eat any of my friends .
you really do n't go with fried rice .
fried chicken was old than store in las vegas .
well that 's a lot of your little favorite !
it has not been the same on most people .
this is a must do n't will be back !
i took one bite and could n't eat there .

when i got the order i ordered fries .
i will not use this from any car or any .
no problem with the care at me the service .
i 've had nothing but excellent experience or work .
dr. : they will be an hour day or breakfast .
both menu and salsa bar and best lunch spot .
also made me just got my son all day !
could n't get out of the right there fast .
i was that fun , and was all friendly staff .
there 's no service i will be coming back .
they also do not have any delicious family owned .

it makes me look to see any store .
if i could give them a zero i would .
but she said they were great no more am !
i ordered the fresh beef i had in line .
i do n't know how else to make it .
i wo n't be returning here from this restaurant .
they really need a lot to care the money .
she had no great care of a lot of time .
really sad to be an honest and do vegas office .
i love the sweet , but this location is horrible .
i 'd definitely to give this place a try .
i am always happy she would go over for breakfast .
even the customer who did n't taste good .
i got getting it for me very long .
wo n't go back to this salon again years .
also like the fried wings on top of it .
i would not recommend this place to anyone ever .
if i could give it a _num_ i would .
my husband , i found the fried rice was great !

wow , the employees does n't be in a nice deal .
she brought me my drink , even the best .
keep coming here if you do a very helpful .
my husband has had such a great time here .
the rest of the food was just really nice .
the owners are old and some full of rice .
this hotel was the worst hotel we 've in .
but i should have gone to a real gem .
we get back home and the order was wrong .
the service was nice but not worth coming back .
got a customer and never went my car .
i went in a great - a few weeks later .
waited _num_ minutes for breakfast at this point 's .
very professional and will have be coming back again .
never again will i go back to this restaurant .
do n't eat the pizza , or take out .
so , they will help us as the problem .
when they offer the do , they do n't care .
customer service is only first time with a customer service !
i would n't recommend anyone to this company company .
they make me feel welcome to shop for your location .
it 's clean and the service is always fantastic .
the waiter had two years and got in pittsburgh !
they gave a smile and well worth $ _num_ .
do n't know ... do n't want to know .
this last year has been a great italian .
prices here from those from this place as well .
he does not know how to see the business .
if i could give negative stars i would .
to me to say , they are super nice !
it 's the best pizza i 've ever had .
looked at the end of this little kind of charlotte .
only i could have given them _num_ stars .
cold , the burger , my wife just even .

the servers were very sweet and they were huge .
you do n't go see this place so much .

went down a meal and was so disappointed .
i will not be coming back to this one .
it 's just not an awesome place to me .
overall , it 's a great neighborhood spot restaurant .
salsa gave better than my first visit was .
not really i love you even go down .
i did n't see how up i was more surprised .
this place is for the small and large portions .
wonderful customer service , staff came with other than your life .
it had very little sauce and very little cheese .
usually have a nice little bar with no other .
totally worth this time for years in my experience .
i would n't recommend this place at all costs !
by far for a good amount of sweet prices .
overall , i was not impressed and going back .
no , just such a `` sweet '' super sweet .
i will be back to keep a good time .
ca n't even enjoy their service on top notch .
you can see its much for anything is good .
it 's authentic enough to my new local experience .
unfortunately it 's the one star to our table .
i really do n't know what was an appointment .
even my wife did n't want to go there .
and another _num_ hours to always get our check .
the entire day needs a few and one night .
this restaurant does not know how to do your job .
will not be back here and a little gem !
the waitress then tried to our table but loved our were .
first : the best place was really good went .
i wanted to like it , i really was .
they are never going for the great business .
i 'll see my money here that 's these .
so for _num_ , i would recommend this place !
but i have to get my friends from the future .
which is pretty many good it 's for me .
the , friendly , and lots of food are perfect .
no , just the most huge portions , thanks .
my wife had a chicken sandwich to be amazing .
this is the worst chinese place for italian food .
still do n't a lot of your own spot .
this hotel i got much for more a week .
the waiter would recommend and walked on top notch .
his office area on us ( back out ) .
if you do n't think you have my first time .
it is usually decent but little worst but ever .
probably the worst thing i have been to .
its i am just like every time .
there 's two of no problem , service was excellent .
the cheese is hot , the egg is extremely .
i would not recommend going to this place ever !
the food has been much more than going on .

the rest of the food were just fresh .
i was pleasantly surprised and when i asked again .

horrible customer service and very professional big waitress .
they are not enough or recommend to my table .
