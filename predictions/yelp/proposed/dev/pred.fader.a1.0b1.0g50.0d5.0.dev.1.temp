by far the worst dining experience i 've ever had in my entire life .
i was so glad to find a place me wanted , with good reviews .
very well and pricey ... not too many bar or bring to choose from .
to make sure waiter , the place has all the atmosphere of a really of .
i show up a few minutes late and still never like hot _num_ fried sauce .
when you will get your money our orders to check out another large and get .
called having from a positive experiences to several an appointment for an oil change .
simply the food just a different and a salsa , that does , that .
i used to love the crab had however , this problem i feel delicious .
after he had just cooked there literally waiting for waiting for over _num_ minutes .
my husband and i went to we went and we tried from the phone through .
very he asked when he should return they 'll check it else 's else .
it was easy to shop because there is not many people in the valley .
even when they about he need you have paid asked for their little of food .
long time by these have does n't eat now on a go with _num_ .
i asked for a to go for a month left a minutes and shrimp .
i 've stayed at other people left before and no it was n't great .
he was extremely impressed at first but beyond any being they were `` by .
i will never be back to recommend `` have to pay not cheap trust .
i was told that i would have to wait over a week for strip .
she was not a fan of the she had sent in , or rice .
my bread soup looks disgusting , was n't do i like nice be back .
i would spend my ice cream and up a group much to bring without today .
this place did not and i was excited to finish my $ _num_ bucks .
i 've had better from other greasy greasy and avoid having in shopping with brunch .
let me were n't too long cold our party of _num_ was seated .
needs a new thing , they say '' as `` is it on _num_ .
no , no reason to be high of people , no drinks , no me .
this place does n't be nice if pool the _num_ star rating on sunday .
here , this dish is , tasteless was old and has better to no .
_num_ % tip from your $ _num_ or more professional '' you needed up .
some other they price and each people i recommend the little a better lot !
no one should have to wait _num_ hours behind to talk a complete friend .
i recently went in to a neighborhood in true great management is take away .
be sure and him , i tried up am too after those him here .
if you do n't ... well be up for new to get your time .
i guess if you do n't think it soon that it 's over $ _num_ .
they do n't even take my salad ( _num_ ) ( more to me ) .
waitress `` if i would like to up it and i can bring their sauce .
they had some hard hard people he gets this `` one if you can .
took a great restaurant with me bar with a fried , which as we felt .
i had _num_ minutes to make it to the new location before they closed .
a little more patio and more people needs a `` hotel that was a solid .
some of the food did ok , never kept to the business as a whole .
it 's not to cute i live tried to know their more to amazing business .
never was waited on the while people it actually took long out of order .
after _num_ minutes my pizza was out but only the pizza and no wings .
finally to this places to the another single i 'll why i one this .
the lady that did my own did not even put a huge be on beer .
she was beyond rude , even when brought us on both to the customers .
the bread bread was juicy , shrimp , and so much give me car .
which is also a place i would not want to ever go back to .
we stopped by the drive thru since bill to pick up breakfast 's new months .
by the time our food got the time to taste the chicken were fair .
overall would never visit that again location and would n't always them to it .
i 'm disappointed to say i 'll be ordering this one for my now .
the , being my burrito food was better than the crust that my top .
super like well salad ... still too salad with phoenix ... slow best experience .
i could go on and on and i guess you can see the check .
not be how friendly and they are trying to make any chicken be right ?
i tell how sweet there , i 'm n't happy that burgers to eat . )
i love mexican food and was outstanding ( homemade 's fries and with delivery .
come on people , the is the prices and my entire look at new !
i asked for cooked a '' store but our room because of bbq dessert .
it had only been used a few times so it still actually use them .
the lady that was quite extremely rude and did n't care one more really room .
my wife and i thought the salad tasted more like that manager came here .
i say again , do n't ever ever ever ever seen at this hotel !
terrible customer service even let me even how ... it off , a sunday card .
first when i walk into i recommend the place is the kind of so low .
honestly , i think there are probably better places to eat in the area .
you get what you pay for ... or come experience to go this meal .
there were many people found a restaurant and the burger is were dinner surprised !
food was warm that was n't to be cold and chicken were cold and most .
i went to 's across the street in and very food to much _num_ .
needless to say we 've too long for more , very not very family satisfied .
the food is not cooked all the way , and , great & put .
i took my _num_ year old without last more during their last day last week .
and bring look like they have had a whole shop owner and could make up .
when we received our order it was under forward on his husband our problem .
the experience was awful and they have `` been small people when service _num_ .
i really do n't even live this place will i wo n't eat anything here .
apparently , service was super not professional and made rice and really place was .
going in with a long for a quick hours to i loved the fish .
at the very best it should have been under $ _num_ for it all .
one time i came in on a saturday and one only seemed the person was fine .
all this is not for a really cute with little to no other had .
save on my last visit and i do n't think i will take for my real ?
got off the phone later _num_ minutes later the took my order was some .
it tastes instead of the delicious , fried chicken , why usually who have experienced .
we waited _num_ minutes while there recently sat in us once someone me once .
worst stay of my life , i wish i could get my money back .
i was given and a big ( the manager because the bill _num_ extra .
i was just there as long as if i had ordered in the store .
for some reason , my room had some lots of really easy all the price .
it did n't taste horrible , tasty so ... nothing and a completely be .
absolutely , since i am , i 'll have to have zero _num_ minutes .
the room is simple with a small small experience , use , and it off .
my one take of some pasta and actually come to eat in , very comfortable .
the waiter said i could n't take the shrimp home because it was delicious .
then i waited another _num_ for a another , which was cold when hot .
i tried to bring and the some no green who did n't bother chocolate .
finally my nails done very close as i waited for the wait here just done .
they really need to get some _num_ min in that `` know that to treat .
make sure you have time to come , me of almost over dinner last !
i had the egg rolls , pork , and cheese sandwich and the cheese .
this is the sales time in a we , will not you ever be !
so he offered to the green _num_ really salmon of _num_ pieces salad choices .
so he refused to tell me my order and then asked for the money .
after slow service this morning i tried to it served up my business guy .
i do n't want to spend extra shrimp ) home of your lunch hour .
this hotel was the worst i have ever stayed in as husband and had .
, far i like other than bad to order from town a store chain .
i , with yourself a with lots of this past this company night last .
let my burger was sitting in less like she a and has tried usually .
the meat is quiet , average , and does n't even taste like chicken .
another _num_ minutes go by my time told she then told me _num_ minutes .
the selection was better but probably because it 's a couple of mexican to it .
i highly recommend that you go back you go when you want to get .
but 's are not on at least with high food ... beautiful and professional .
when i thought the store , i did not let one lot of food .
got a simple day , because i could get a she comes cooked oil .
i asked them to put it on sunday until after this review can visit .
i will not recommend anyone to this location or any of their way it .
not the best mexican best we 've been to , but it 's cheap !
we gave up on getting him off our nails and walked out without yelp .
the customer service that i experienced here was on cooked with any other salon .
next , the pool was $ _num_ ( i also ordered a she ) .
i gave him the same large , thank you right to cut a comfortable .
you 're not going to find any of that food -- be full .
the customer service is usually awful the and clearly is easy do n't same .
sadly , it took another extra _num_ mins for the food came to , etc .
_num_ hours after we ordered they want to know you used to the meal .
is their so many that so what i can seem to guys working like '' ?
the next time , we found that the water without ever always from probably .
i also that says how was so best and was no other available behind .
i had to choose _num_ star rating , i could n't be until through !
plus oh on the one of the spicy ( see chips and stale are .
if i ever come to phoenix to visit i will not be returning here .
honestly this is one of the worst food dining restaurants i have ever had .
super , garlic or pork & eggs chips are what a entire breakfast place .
ordered a large large and it were perfect there to cold for fresh _num_ mins .
why are they taking over all the some , service , ( and good ?
i asked if she could give the pizza and would get it at my _num_ .
the `` small '' is n't in the door you at it really many good .
i had it to write another time , out my wife in _num_ mins .
my husband and i came here because we were n't taking the home back .
my son is easily , crispy , getting a that has just exceptional .
every time i take by the store i 'm of the best last of the hotel .
we will be there 's another month and not coming back to this location .
i 'm not sure the food was old or it 's a great food .
would had it finally they just her for her what i 'm had my fish .
so in , one that is better them ... just , do n't just ever .
every times i had really with _num_ & there is did n't quality warm .
long short short , _num_ of us _num_ % tables and they were empty .
these do n't been chinese at some point , the fish and were tasteless and .
needless to say , we all eating here and then sat to our waitress .
my , pedicure , however so came out with bacon ; the on fun .
i have to say it 's the worst service instead of probably i go .
i kept her no her but she no sushi to she 'd come in them .
this place was like a delicious and put no one could even get us .
the service was very very very very very slow , and a wrong order .
i can deal with poor customer service , but its attention in a large !
i would n't buy a review on a friday and definitely it off me off .
unfortunately , i am to say & the used about the day of dinner here .
other pizza places can take cream and be when he will be through anyone .
my wife was thin , was lacking and had was `` a just bad .
they 're my order up and then were `` just trying to fix it .
they did not bother trying anything until i asked if they were closed .
a <UNK> will person you first after a chicken of now my own .
i went back through the finally with another better to said ... staff .
this would have been the second time the tried to charge me charge .
if anything , she seemed someone that she had to do the order .
but i am not sure about the lunch of those sauce are a `` .
also fresh , beef , can crispy , and the real just portion .
needless to say , i would n't recommend this company to anyone ever !
it was two two star on top that but is a horrible bit !
one looks not was the absolute because to make what way by one .
finally , we were to believe in her very easy to take he place .
the rooms were very clean and the waitress we were in was comfortable .
i leave not even a great while away meal without for back late ) .
tried to serve office and who took and my never asked to the manager .
of course , i called through and they said they would immediately immediately .
to be honest the employees thing that was good , the waitress made .
there are extremely disappointed and i wish the customer is the worst my friends .
it 's a shame to watch this place take the hidden it has .
when she came to work i am they gave me chicken and shrimp .
then they did not the have part and for the next time for him !
has the if my mom but he let my hair when you oil pick .
as amazing , the quality and lots of the sandwiches are not ready .
i walk away and go to the anyone and ask for a manager .
i immediately eating eating and making it in the world and still the tried .
that makes me you are not paying attention to what you are doing .
when she started off our food she gave us the check as well .
however , just the other night , i found my pizza in my salad .
i got like a couple and it had about getting of egg water .
for something that 's the `` so all who got our and left .
this is always dirty , and smelled , is also dining or its .
i can enjoy the extra because i know how then such be can .
it takes many , lots , maybe and only help even to return !
the neighborhood is bad and it in making the there chinese their customers .
a little over an hour amount shopping too ) well horrible customer service .
they lost cheese and do n't know how to deal with the what !
this location on the other hand is dirty , is nice and unprofessional .
in a couple with a nice if always do n't waste your here .
he was let was clearly little , he so just he could take off .
this seems to be a always different told that i do n't like .
the `` she makes to be awful to waiting if it is only good ?
another _num_ minutes because you and only in they left a month and it .
i feel like fresh up , a beautiful who would have more me !
i had her order the steak and shrimp with shrimp did of money .
was in the area and thought i would stop in for a burger .
i recently with a manager , waited people about our happy hour drinks .
did n't offer hot and sour soup at lunch , only shrimp name .
my salad was dry and my wife 's fries and really little a burger .
as oh some the sales one of the what who comes to clean .
not her , and this location is going to pay for her mistake .
i had to spend the day during and getting last of green ; !
i ca n't do this place & will never recommend it to anyone .
we waited _num_ minutes we were not even brought any more or anything .
also , completely said the bacon are a did to watch and out ?
however is in the counter there 's how that 's what she ordered !
it took us about _num_ min to get the wine on the table .
why probably to avoid how you would be ready to be doing your ?
the waitress just made the he really would pay for is to clean up .
now pizza is beyond awful and wings are down there so many good .
i have never not had to wait in a couple minute wait line .
: : the chicken of the let who gave in my salad bar enjoyed !
the food looked old , the entire burrito , it just looked gross .
she offered a couple hours with getting flavor with that , small but also .
had no idea it was true and sour dishes of and every staff .
first bite was great , we gave my wife that it was seriously .
so i do not recommend this location last , they are definitely enough .
i the rooms are open little has been for over three months now .
i call them and they did and tell me they will tell me .
i do n't know what happened the but group enjoyed it took no year .
the guy said sorry for the wait but he did n't believe it .
i asked them how long it would take our give me total _num_ .
i said , i 'm sorry , i did n't see any n't understand .
this has to be the worst pizza location since i have been to .
without ; , i had received a month for a free wine salad .
so they leave you with a terrible experience another place , we style .
i paid _num_ for a no _num_ min with a manager but totally crowded .
this place was too tough ... , and the food was looking nasty .
they need to people their work manager nice and how maybe service works !
i ordered a chicken crispy arrived with fries and two to rolls back .
the entire staff was trying to help me with a they used to .
there , do n't take the car out of them to come here .
been here for about _num_ - maybe still is n't totally in the love .
not going to having having another back with maybe before we so always .
ok , all done with red lobster for a good long now while .
i have to go that _num_ years the many such for extremely empty .
my food experience was just so long and terrible at the same time .
ask or super fresh dishes and new you even they offer fried chicken .
i told the lady that it was great and she did n't stop .
when i first walked in , i was hit with that flavorful smell .
i ca n't believe that i just paid $ _num_ for her a `` .
but on the side side they do have hot salsa as an option .
i am not sure what was worse ... the food is work .
there were a of us menu on us to serve us in our room .
the front desk never called to check if the had been been friendly .
this place does n't even make a star because i love this year .
this is my second trip to this place and both bad experiences experiences .
i ca n't help but how only entire for has the coffee usually spot .
it 's like you asked them to walk _num_ min to get some .
the course is in even bad guy from when the rolls were cold .
the meat was like a lunch meat of more fish italian selection itself .
it was like our really was been over from under green they had .
my boyfriend got crispy chicken and two chicken and we said everything that .
i wanted to give you zero stars but it would n't let me .
we did n't have to wait very long before our meal was delivered .
many best they used i want to be to get a drink around ?
not _num_ people later me down i was in there and i was gone .
i gave them _num_ % special called me of same and no me .
in fact , this place just was not a fun place to be .
lots of with the counter to the hell low service is so many `` .
too much bread ( on n't been is ok busy and mediocre ( meat .
it was n't horrible tasting food , just bland , what you can charge .
i have never had such terrible service , especially from real as well .
we walk out for cooked the car or just that went , perfect .
there was a warm large burger beautiful for cooked especially and into the future .
we 've at having a _num_ star , but this is the worst .
the front desk was open off of the no menu that the made .
the egg beef with she make someone which was kind the which seemed .
let me be treated as time i can do n't like this place .
if you ask after they give you your own they get all costs .
plus he was n't very helpful with my car walked in the one .
i hate them for not getting me this $ _num_ by far called .
i do n't know what happened but the crust is not the same .
i 'd believe they have their sweet on a cute if but they offer .
unfortunately we will never make the many of going to this location again !
finally the food comes , and of course , the order is wrong .
there was no or anything to anything to ever said that did n't .
other than that i do n't know who else could use this place .
the problem is the management & the entire staff they do not look anything .
do n't waste your money here if you are looking for a meal .
she did my use was so rude and `` what do you think ? ''
best three most of the most soup , they never offered my call .
you wo n't get good attention available to sit being about your extra .
it just looked like the salty had been made and that 's it .
the when i found i felt the time to my room was really awful .
i love the wings but they are n't worth the counter not too friendly .
i 'm glad i got this for such a cheap price through coming .
the salad was on the valley , beautiful , on me anything the day .
i think better there ... best but probably 's manager ( 's ?
i have better restaurants at home crab 's waste of white 's kind .
it was our first time at red beef , and probably our last .
i out of every place of the there to will never ever come back !
made an appointment to get my oil had put at on sunday on probably .
also the manager is & probably they always do not finish _num_ dollars !
if we had several us bar the all did not go to be bbq !
she would have helped me completely had i would not pay your bill .
that 's too bad this company is the this bar and my whole life .
sat down and three times they free stayed that came we for said .
nothing to write home about , but i 'll it if on yelp .
i recently my boyfriend changed with those you 've been getting my dog .
my husband thought the soup was good and the egg roll was crispy .
after this experience , we also be like if definitely to see to return .
always have been n't sitting in years you can see anything on them .
ordered the family owned but usually _num_ wings , fries and bread garlic .
they were out of thin , so i had more egg on it .
i have to say , i find the meat to be super easy .
maybe helped would be ready for making _num_ . to _num_ % business .
the place was taken and the entire behind the counter was incredibly rude .
how else can one put the _num_ and _num_ stars for this place ?
my boyfriend and i love this office ; recommended , free ; at night .
there 's reasonable time at spring to be , made no stay here .
my appetizer was cold , half of the amount of soup were phenomenal .
this was the most disgusting place i 've stayed in a long time .
i went to red red pork with my family the service was horrible .
it was a burger burger salty with tasty ; , thank & cheese .
i _num_ different just each in the to <UNK> is much which is now .
food was `` small , maybe i did just the wrong they thing .
service - ... avoid , while pie soup up the only good said .
the chicken was n't side , and tasted , like it was two .
i would rather be over empty be one way away in this place .
however i have two pieces which that takes in such a low rating .
i ca n't believe that they did n't give me like each or he .
i had to tell one of the good however they did n't care .
the owner wo n't return through and the staff does n't help .
the was decent was decent , but after it was all downhill !
no way i could make it across town on a friday night .
unfortunately , a wonderful of their other here the are really comfortable .
( to eat , not to , love , but in to see .
that they had it they had on it , since i even ask .
if you like these chinese chinese places , then without this review .
there were like _num_ or _num_ other tables in the whole place .
she said it 's i had a `` parking or that of everything .
had i found it i would have it given a customer _num_ .
: : many best , you hate the more for your service .
she took us had two and told me they was not cold .
the drive thru is dirty dirty and the only are service too !
they want to so cheese me a couple me a next line !
the store manager told the guy behind to give me an appointment .
i do not are wrong , do n't have to and never have .
while i was eating , a will full salad one wedding !
we still had to wait almost than our party 's wedding call .
this place does n't deserve any customer service their customer is horrible !
when is the last time you were here '' who are most thin .
me and my husband went here last night an month for dinner .
i called the sandwich before the entire time it with my you 're .
then , the server tried to charge me for a new your !
she ended up with a little _num_ different also on her sweet .
the service sucked spent from the second we walked in the door .
we found _num_ in a timely of the , he was n't surprised .
both times the bartender was too busy to take my order dinner .
not just stopped with this place , probably wo back here again .
i was disappointed that our pizza did n't have that this time .
and the staff in the counter is the worst very nice are most .
i did n't care for the food , thought it was bland .
guess i 'll have to keep to serve during for $ _num_ salad .
she did n't me able or me or seriously that i was .
i spent $ _num_ and they want me to pay for just parking .
i totally small but the though he said it was very unprofessional .
probably the least chinese chinese food i 've had in my life .
he got me so hate our review she left my tea treated .
then he had to leave and try and get my wedding because .
the egg roll , cooked over , greasy , greasy and old !
but quite expensive if you are not into that type of thing .
usually , i could use my n't see away but if '' .
the service was friendly but the food was not worth the money .
she said , `` they 're really busy in the back . ''
the worst experience i have ever had at a who 's family !
she walked out and left me in there for an hour half waiting .
it is all about up your weekend and 'm probably at this vet .
he finally things like i could n't have `` high '' quality .
the front desk said for pancakes to and she then so him .
right now , _num_ small salad half house where are _num_ different .
if the fact which would 've tried was i on one of i .
who does n't want to every single person of their lunch hour ?
there are way better than places here so someone where help else .
since her people - why is n't there a zero star '' rating ?
and food is cold , soggy , not enough by any pool .
the pizza was decent and the food were sweet , fresh and fresh .
very many choices in fact to meat , or , and delicious .
it was the most most amazing called chicken which did n't have done .
the cheese actually make be the same _num_ minutes , to it .
my man did n't even finish his good and there 's only .
by far one of the worst places restaurants i 've ever had .
they would n't make it from our bill until helped any water .
i called to help one of my kids an never half much .
all in all , we were really disappointed and will not return .
the whole drink area was a mess as was the area area .
they give you a second wait time , but did n't understand .
all i could taste was extremely tough was large and local when seasoned .
i only go since it is on the way home from work .
so we sat there for _num_ minutes before she even left quickly .
i guess everyone is so used to their variety and most it outside .
now , the one star i thought was terrific , is not .
this is honestly the worst all i only have ever in charlotte .
my poor company , with no flavor at _num_ only old _num_ & .
the server was seriously , the food was , as mediocre at best .
if this is a very stop it is not a good one .
it simply did n't pay me great on so i easy to .
with the first bite i thought it was not what i expected .
i then asked how long it would take was _num_ hours later .
i ca n't wait to get your salad of because of this !
my husband had a horrible experience with the staff at this dealership .
a lot and once and i am these because about another experience .
we waited for _num_ minutes and pick up started with no food .
the feel rice was sitting a lot for the outside on the crab .
but what was n't bland was the green cake in the food .
they even view and your soup was nice breakfast in the counter .
the ambiance just gets worse as you 're looking and walked out .
they also left a simple greasy short on my light light $ .
we walked in and the place was dirty and not well maintained .
i would they have wish how over to different meal about well .
i am sad to see how much this place has gone downhill .
only reason i gave them _num_ star is because i had to .
for , we had my husband even soup with shrimp and shrimp .
i 'm only giving one star because i ca n't give zero .
but of those of , i am looking , truly new this evening .
first , the waitress was super sweet to pick up my customers .
then someone finally such a second review , so , i am here .
i tried a side of different they 've and had very well told .
i also asked for hot sauce , menu what i got instead ?
for that reason , i 'll 'll stay away from this establishment .
i was there were on the , and since it was old easy .
other than the food which was lacking , but was the service .
they were cold over he so we asked for something a little pricey .
when you 're glad down , huge for some do to the portion .
probably is probably the only mall in buy this whole nail since .
when `` yes , he 's hard are just who did me .
i need to take my card and ask for my money back .
_num_ and a half hours for a _num_ min a year oil change .
the vegetables was made and the food goes into the same day .
the pasta was greasy and tasteless , very little cheese was big cheese .
so we did definitely get to call him but almost by its .
the rest are good , rolls , very wings and rude & !
when i arrived to pick it up they did n't have it .
very disappointing , customer service very poor and food was not good .
it a couple in the wall in the lack of always my decent .
upon because because the great customer service i was definitely is on also .
could n't check the second room since our dog did n't work .
said she 'd be back with it , never took with one .
i 're a bad to think your dog for a big after salad .
a month later , i still had not received my back again .
it would have been fine or i would have went else where .
the place was dirty with a large rolls around out of half .
apparently , i was not the only one with the past issue .
the only reason my waitress was well are warm with delivery taco .
the room room working , but that was n't even the mess .
she had time to me on the meal , i say no .
the store is very busy from start to about at `` price .
took _num_ minutes to get our drinks and the order was wrong .
they always mess up my order and give me the wrong food .
they do n't have a bad person working through the drive thru .
she did trying to give a order of drinks without on top .
i still even take my own in the itself 's put back .
first off we were treated getting over the drive thru order glad .
i was disappointed to see the having nail since these : right ?
i had never been to a a while felt good than a must .
we are eating and _num_ it at this review and because it quickly .
i would not recommend this salon , since i will be returning .
i guess i need to eat or on two more next time .
the only thing different is that they serve the fresh rib also .
the manager was sitting at the _num_ finally while we enjoyed our drinks .
but it me off the two different food for a same atmosphere .
it took them two days to come out and they want my food .
the waiter did n't how you and the order was up served .
i am not sure what the big deal , is this about .
it actually actually be worse than little taco 's or most just menu .
had we had any other choices , we would have taken them .
she brought us and said as usual as soon and we walked in .
in the servers and the little warm comes on top of high !
our waitress seemed seemed so just _num_ minutes one to came and garlic .
this is a friend and having all that bad menu do n't understand .
the office never are new and let is n't never see great manager .
manager said i could pay more to get a complete very sweet pie .
save your money and get a $ _num_ hot oil oil !
as soon as she sent me she else there was i guess .
the customer service is none the rest and the seriously are rude .
maybe that 's why the inside of the restaurant was so crowded .
however , now as an excellent , left the hotel was the same .
oh and side of potatoes were so salty it comes the meal .
put the meat and came to see _num_ stars , maybe it .
called in a long time from this location and it was late .
this is by far the worst nail salon i have been too .
we should have gotten up and walked out to go somewhere else .
not to mention , they make up on my 's dogs order .
when to believe , i was used to give the a chance .
just got a just fantastic pizza for the location in _num_ tables .
i did n't have gotten , just a hit with a great .
they need more staff , thank did top , and , although .
my husband and i were dining here for here last last year .
the about she did n't even have came pizza in a wonderful variety .
i would n't trust 's trust to do n't come to the after .
another had had car put a week when and definitely hidden in its .
i drive back there and wait in line to return my food .
so we had it out , for his breakfast ... its sucks !
trying to have a other in the office and said was sorry !
they for a `` wonderful for a very poor quality service .
the was decent was decent , but after it that went downhill !
worst room i have ever stayed in charlotte in my entire life .
also , most of the sandwiches are extra all the time .
stopped this place and their lack of white chicken and had .
she would spend on the down for a decent meal cost .
another that should that should n't have was by in the valley .
they are so busy only _num_ people working the food counter .
this place is the worst place i have ever been too .
the food is average quality and cost is not that great .
sorry but extremely someone at them and will never be back !
even the manager i wanted to was n't up to finish .
absolutely ridiculous , i would not recommend this location at all !
if i had a a group rolls to live , i liked .
however , i 'm not paying for any of things things .
i was disappointed with the steak fries as they were brought .
i got one $ _num_ % but it did n't were .
the selection was always my easy sweet , but quality and high .
the pizza and the wings were n't all that good either .
the very nice how behind the manager said about it before .
i thought literally got were bad , these take the cake !
this on the other hand was a lot my burger the owner .
take out dinner for cost cost $ _num_ ... $ _num_ !
i do n't even think we 'll return going back there .
this is just not a good way to run a business .
i seriously so made so right now eating after there tonight .
no eggs no green garlic and give and almost more dollars !
i would avoid this place as their own wings are sales .
yelp is my review , my boyfriend , and my life .
so they 're so $ _num_ weeks of someone sauce in arizona ? )
the just food is all in fried it inside and really hot .
they were rude , rude and extremely hard to deal with .
first off , their out who is all over the place .
asked to talk with he walked and `` do not anything .
they had less each the phone to what over the _num_ dishes .
which i expected , i have been to bring before before .
the place looks gross , old and not clean at all .
he was extremely rude , and he said up on me !
one of the worst neighborhood i 've have ever been too !
asked for sausage egg cheese toast with bacon cheese of charlotte .
i 'm pretty sure you 'll walk out of there went !
i had to stay away in the soup ( good _num_ .
this place is horrible , ca n't even finish my lunch .
i like rather like having but this location is the worst .
you can keep your own date and salsa fish , did .
honestly , i would only leave zero stars if i could .
as of those how this buffet is a hit or miss .
could give another give another place and if which is bad !
i have never had a regular ; most only _num_ minutes .
the service was friendly and the food was n't very expensive .
the wait was reasonable , especially for brunch on a sunday .
i 'm not how about a couple few minutes done through .
that should have been been finally , someone could get sick .
they , then and after a other for why i am done .
at that point i had it was and over it for bad .
i , and my friends will avoid this airport for now .
great burgers , even a bit you shrimp is the same .
this is the absolute worst experiences i 've ever been to .
i have been a big whole local for many years .
_num_ for a spicy did they did n't charge for me here .
to the manager she offered a you expect a fried cold !
if i could give this place no stars , i would .
but think it might make it _num_ full a simple pizza overpriced .
i never got a call and a hit was never made .
the eggs says it 's only good tonight at the game .
two other customers had orders orders at the same time too .
do not use this company at all trying i someone someone else .
my husband on a we was n't been , , at all .
in fact to being wrong , the food was absolutely disgusting .
if it was possible i would give it a negative star .
she was so loud ; what the restaurant will end first joint .
last i tried _num_ minutes _num_ was _num_ hour and _num_ minutes .
and its not the first time that service was bad there .
we left at front _num_ our night $ _num_ days to one .

this is not something the family should have to deal with !
went through drive through , ordered two _num_ % chicken 's chicken .
the fried fried was huge , extremely off , and helpful .
unless out the hours are definitely , it by their service .
do not get back rooms is my mexican that of wait .

the potatoes were cold and so was the so cheese and cheese .
several others walked in him me also with cheap on yelp .

husband ordered the rice and it too was cooked well done .
the staff is rude , prompt and just a bad experience .
i really do n't get why people come here so often .
we could n't tell who who works and there did n't .
the food was n't bad , but it did offer flavor .
do not get up with rice '' ... it 's there .
but now there 's no way i 'll ever go back .
the next room was not under having but what used behind .
in taking the staff never out one car just that quickly so .
the bread bread was not very good , and too salty .
i ordered the chicken asada and it was a little bland .
so , this place was perfect to just pay and go .
the cheese was barely gone and the sauce tasted store was top .
the place did n't even do anything for the past birthday .
there was a lot of staff there , and no customers .
we did n't see her after she asked off our food .
the girl that asked is they completely my order loves my amazing !
first , the cashier she are n't easy to be there .
do n't go here if you want any kind of service .
really , that 's not too much to change , right ?
the crust was okay and there was a lot of it .
i did n't really care where i was going to stay .
very disappointed never going back to this restaurant is horrible !
sadly i have to always no star that this store and ever .
order _num_ days something was _num_ mins which are group good .
no wonder one of them that they serve you horrible food .
she did n't recommend our regular when made a right away .
the service was poor and the atmosphere did n't feel clean .
our waitress , all , was nice , though quite sad .
_num_ minutes to get _num_ cheese house and a small large .

places in line and get to the front and no pizza .
for the soup , i went with the chicken & delicious .
this particular for over a month i will not have after .
we were so disappointed the chicken fried chicken is so terrible .
unfortunately i ca n't so i have to give them one .
it did n't take long to take out what it was .
not only is the service terrible , the management is terrible .
i love you , i have no problem does my way .
doctor said that i had food got to live size meat .
when we received our order of wings , they were cold .
the place was crowded on sunday for most bacon ( day ) .
the worst experience i have ever had at an location fantastic .
the only good thing about this place is that its cheap .
to top it off the food was prepared with no longer .
i ca n't see what other people see in this place .
$ _num_ plus however for two people , one room needs !
the thin was flavorless and the fries were cold and of .
but there came a problem that i could n't get more .
actually do n't have time to mention about a little what .
walked out of this place after _num_ minutes of no service .
i used to love trying garden but its so she and probably .
i asked for _num_ months , brought _num_ and got more i .
the point of having a _num_ hour location is for lunch .
when the food finally arrived , it was n't anything else .
she then did not give the finally up with a reason !
it took me _num_ minutes to just drive back you way .
the are comfortable , shop ca n't , someone what that .
they need a nice if and were a big hit i find .
if i could give this a negative star , i would .
i asked if i could get one from an room empty .
so i asked there , a drive and he the place .
if you go in make sure you do not get an !
i love the total and left my wife at the restaurant .
since _num_ mins light sitting and this soup ( a crispy _num_ .
i do n't understand why they do n't do n't same either .
the decor was a lot of probably i was too disappointed .
call the front desk and takes one , this is great .
instead , they made everything so much hard and more more .
it was hot but i 'd ordered , no pizza 's !
this is a oil change makes friends with two other did good .
but they wo n't be getting any friends any if off .
do n't come here without make an return left hours later .
anyway and my family will not be returning to the place .
it 's very loud , a fries and there probably services there .
to start off i wish i could give them zero stars .
my pasta was so dry that it was almost making together .
why am i still even live into are awesome and which ?
also the potatoes had no hot water and no water water .
i am not even wonder definitely going here as anything or .
any little restaurant , for that , maybe was better pizza .
( being : here : old does n't have them ) .
she did n't even even bother there i got very disappointing .
so my wings came out _num_ months before there was done .
not took the restaurant but so because of that was good .
please keep are they looking for a great into a more !
i gave my friend coming to me ask for excellent food .
really old nice and `` that seem to run super nice .
i waited for _num_ minutes to open to take my are $ .
honestly i took the room and the `` to sit which .
they said the manager was there but could n't find us .
so of course i am going to use the whole visit .
the owners are too hard and do n't bring her coffee .
no one should wait for what i had to wait for .
needless , i went about my boyfriend on service at my day .

gave it 's having management it 's a complete deal .
none of the _num_ employees in the kitchen kitchen me .
only reason i gave a drive was man me is right just ? ?
while the pizza was decent , the wings were awesome .
shame i ca n't give this place a review review .
to actually , the back , quite our burrito was prompt .
not a great selection , but if really big ( .
we started homemade questions and he was being very rude .
i 'm because because good customer service would have been .

food is ok but service is something that is lacking .
there was an employee been size while he was working .
it was totally bland and was with sour cheese with cheese .
food was disgusting , she chicken , cold and soggy .
the second room was better , but still nothing spectacular .
if you like that itself makes negative thing going ?
if i could rate it _num_ stars , i would .
the place is by & and top inside and out .
apparently the finally went since and <UNK> did n't care .
i recently with how excellent , the service is awesome !
she did n't even bother to come over my way .

if i only had know i would never walk in .
what a shame of a business you are trying up .
if i could give it zero stars , i would .
this was after i paid them to fix my pool .
i walked in and they told me they 're doing .

we paid _num_ minutes of others rolls to charge a very .
they took a lot of because of almost bad but .
this location does n't even come close to know everything .
the guy in front of us was sandwich in good .
this was the worst one i 've ever been to !

i have never felt so uncomfortable until in my life !
so got off from a _num_ hour its long been .

trying to get in and out is a great manager .
i was a little disappointed with the quality and portion .

this woman has no business being in the worth he .
spent _num_ minutes later that we used to be hot too .
i almost almost _num_ min ago at just _num_ really .
which is less than we paid for by the way .
while we have been getting several there that all chicken .
not a good hotel never a bad night for them ?
i would n't go here for a meal ever again .
the ice cream ( ) ( definitely is no more .
any front desk , and it 's totally cool inside .
finally they said it 'll be ready in _num_ mins .
the ca n't looked mexican , up there with full selection .
as soon as you walk in the room it comes .
it was a _num_ % bowl for friends ; dog .
so , fresh , they left me waiting for that .
second night the room was not cleaned and no wonder .
wo n't return and keep away of course was great .
no problem , i 'll take my business new hair .
i was told the wait time would be _num_ minutes .
their sales staff are very rude , slow and unprofessional .

_num_ star for that and another for the yummy are inexpensive .
i have n't been in because of definitely on these absolute .
i would give this place a negative negative if possible .

the hotel staff could have n't seem about this business .
this place sucks bad , they used to be good .
he went to everyone a huge pizza but take his the fries .
we were your the time was the waiting , it .
as a far i am always full if this place .
i 've gone with my favorites to buy several here .
no chips on drinks were cooked every were we there .
dogs were happy all over the an spicy their owners .
the pancakes order our garlic garlic were tough and hard .
lots away , got on an french sandwich and of town .
is it too much to ask for a couple call ?
half the time they ca n't get my order right .
it 's now to the point where it 's disgusting .
do not stop here if you are super fast service .
i got there and they only had one _num_ % .
i do n't like big authentic over _num_ large with .
i do n't know how they got such good reviews .
$ _num_ for two _num_ minute never said salad quality .
i did n't want to drink out of my son .
( this was done a week later was this . ''

but i do n't feel my boyfriend is since outside .
anyway , i saw _num_ % that was cute cute .
i felt bad for the owners of this mall has hands .
now i wish why i do n't like getting average .
so me and the wife went here _num_ weeks ago .
all i ate there was extremely greasy and rice sauce .
all the _num_ star reviews are very thin to me .
i will never set until any more - again 's .
i would give this place negative stars if i could .
our wait for food was _num_ minutes because they no .
i enjoyed my small and there were no apology cheese .
needless to say , i have n't been back since .
but why would i , i did n't do them .
started on my lunch while i was asada asada chicken .
needless to say we left and will not be back .
i could n't even bring myself to finish a year old .
i took my boyfriend and unfortunately we were very disappointed .
he did n't care that my wife had already sick .
this even longer almost short , they serve my oil .
do n't bother on quality ingredients a high bar prices .
why would n't she tell me that from the job ?
no food ready for how after if i could check .
i 'm not even when , it was tasted from .
i bought a room with _num_ mins later no rice .
any other store , one could rate a wonderful money .
it did n't like pick so my wife completely called .
_num_ minutes after ordering : two potatoes , no wonder .
i wish i 'd gone to the big variety instead .
i ordered them with no salt , what cheese cheese .
the past _num_ years they have really gone down hill .
it was really disgusting , so i 'll my manager .
the sandwich was served with a not so tasty tasted .
i really liked so much more but was completely disappointed .
the potatoes potatoes are always left a awesome job off .
i do n't know , though , just my opinion .
there was any ice cream any flavor in all burger .
having to wait a long time for just my drink .
unfortunately eating some taco bell would be a better choice .
i 'm usually a big fan of usually high .
i did n't have to give you a their manager .
so i was a little disappointed at this point .
had n't been to this place in _num_ years .
do not trust these people , and also rude .
i probably wo n't be back for another _num_ .
does n't offer and it sauce or anything else .
the manager was nice enough - no big deal .
that was the only good thing about this place .
she says me on their house and one one joke .
the waitresses in the room did n't stop into anyone .
save your money and do n't buy a smile !
no wonder team walked in phoenix up street area .
the pizza came more quickly than we had tasted !
we spent _num_ weeks to stop in while hill .
not like they 're doing the work for free !
the people working seemed very helped my wife sandwich .
it looks like someone 's already such , it ! )
i could n't even eat part of my meal .
you really ca n't go wrong with fried shrimp .
meat around sitting at room area is turned his .
well that 's a great because of $ _num_ !
it has not been the same on several high .
this is a : probably will do n't go !
i took one bite and could n't eat anymore .
so disappointed , most these wo n't be returning .
he did not even bother bring a new meal .
i just spent _num_ days later up , keep .
there were bad really solid in good with watch .
the garlic had no idea chocolate or chocolate pie .
when i live my order the fries were cold .
i will not <UNK> from them any customers either .

i 've had nothing but bad experiences with then .
such little ; will it go down quickly quickly .
walk up menu and salsa bar for lunch only .
which made me just my favorite love my coffee !
could n't get out of the there fast enough .
that is to say , service was totally totally .
there 's no i live will i ever be back .
also they do not have free coffee anything sauce .
our _num_ year old had which seem on her .
unfortunately i will not be eating here again ... .
it makes me never want to buy shopping again .
if i could give them a zero i would .
but she said unfortunately they had no more sauce ?
i mean ordered the special when i walked in .
i do n't know how else to put it .
i wo n't be ordering pizza from here again .
they really need a waitress to run the patio .
she had no longer during a time of town .
not recommended just go to sit or somewhere else .
i love how , but this location is horrible .
i keep trying to give this place a chance .
i am glad we only stayed one night here .
even the mexican will barely did taste the very mediocre .
i got done what i needed to get done .
wo n't go back to this vet house again .
tasted like they put put of salt on it .
i would not recommend this place to anyone ever .
if i could give it a _num_ i would .
of my boyfriend , only the salad was great !
where i come from they , definitely , at them .
do n't ever ever ever stay at this hotel .

she brought me my drink , give the n't fantastic .
avoid coming here if you do n't have to .
my husband has had problems with this location too .
the we of the food was just completely i ordered .
the bartenders are hard so close and under under .
this hotel was the worst hotel we stayed in .
but i should have gone to a real salon .
we get back home and the order was wrong .
the service was nice but not worth coming back .
left them a disappointed and never comes my call .
i went in as a can _num_ % like she .
waited _num_ minutes for breakfast at this morning morning .
very bland and wo n't be coming back again .
never again will i go back to this restaurant .
do n't eat the pizza , or dessert out .
so , his salsa did n't help the problem .
after they do you , they do n't care .
customer service _num_ : never came with a customer !
i would n't think anyone to use this company .
they make me feel welcome to shop for some .
it 's cute and the service is incredibly horrible .
the crab was two years old and had stayed !
they lost a true and for being what as .
do n't know ... do n't want to know .
this last trip may have been the even frozen .
stay as far away from this place as possible .
he does not know how to the business .
if i could give negative rating because i would .
to talk to that , they are super slow !
it 's the worst pizza i 've ever had .
looked at the point of barely any manager sauce .
only wish i could have given them _num_ stars .
cold potato , the cheese would n't even seem .
why are the fast food keep always so busy ?
the food was cold and did not bother roll .
i wish i could give this place negative stars .
i just had a horrible experience with this location .
it 's not hard to find , i recommend .
the were n't fair and they were short short .
you should do your best to avoid this place .
the cashier did n't work , obviously getting quality .
as someone this still turned in the drive thru .
it was pretty much for an almost empty restaurant .
the star is for me and my can room !
unfortunately we had much second then to stay there .
the sides they had was really cool and there .
went to get my nails found <UNK> and loved .
there was no taste to the food at all .
for the price , i did n't expect much .
_num_ hour wait just for them to you extremely !
went tonight on a saturday and was getting disappointed .
i will not be coming back to this one .
it 's just not an enjoyable place to play .
overall , it 's a customer chinese food restaurant .
outside waited _num_ times better than my room did .
not really i think you hate about your prices .
i did n't believe them like i 'm three .
this place is for the cheap and dirty too .
terrible customer service , staff with each other flavor .
it had very little sauce and very little cheese .
almost like a they offer baked with bad but .
totally nice for any family restaurant in my opinion .
i would n't recommend this dealership place at all !
stopped by for a local , but quiet burger .
overall , i was not impressed and enough going .
no toppings , just 'd worst bbq ice cream .
i will be staying will give to get a refund .
ca n't even put their job with shopping shopping .
thank you can plenty being bad ... it is .
it smelled friendly wo to an a bacon day day .
unfortunately it 's the how one to our house .
i really do n't know if it was water .
even my wife did n't want to finish them .
and another _num_ mins just to get our check .
the entire visit without two and a half hours .
this restaurant does not know how to make them .
will not be back ever and 'll a lot !
the waitress then offered to our garlic cheese soup .
first : yeah the place is really really very too .
i wanted to like it , i really did .
they are never return for this by the way .
i 'll spend my money where it 's welcome .
so for _num_ , i would will give this !
but i have to get this off my day .
which is pretty sad since it 's for years .
the , see , for rice and were perfectly .
no , just the regular oil change , thanks .
my boyfriend had several service a crab in it .
this is the worst low for italian food ever .
still ca n't give a $ _num_ per long .
this particular i way over do for an get .
the waiter would go and takes into home on .
service next next door with its cheap and walked out .
if you do n't you wo n't get any .
it is maybe once maybe but not getting times .
probably the worst haircut -- i have been to .
maybe i am just moved at the wrong time .
there where _num_ mins , still service was slow .
the cheese is different , the crust is different .
i would recommend not going to this place ever !
the food has never been much more than shopping .
let the man is any manager was rude and !
the rest of the food items were just gross .
i was 'm old and when i asked again .
the feel when you walk in does n't smile .
it has n't been for quite a few years .
several times were empty , and were not definitely .
i left my son there with having another place .
the place was n't even busy at this time .
it sure was quick , but , come on !
i had to get off and probably and return them .
do not order from here they are the worst !
they were a soggy , greasy , tasteless mess .
horrible customer service and very rude front desk who .
they are not `` or literally to my boyfriend .
usually i recommend the best chicken or chocolate burger ?
