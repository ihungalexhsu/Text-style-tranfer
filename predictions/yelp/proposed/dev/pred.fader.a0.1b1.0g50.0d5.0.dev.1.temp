by far the worst dining experience i 've ever had in my entire life .
i was so excited to find a place if me , with good reviews .
very very and walk ... not too many amount or to choose from .
to make better location , the place has all the atmosphere of a quick .
it on half a few minutes and so never think our go see he .
when you pay for your order her to walk away from your call .
called during this morning at to write an appointment for an oil change .
yes it with a true and also a , fan 's that this .
i used to love the appetizer , but this visit that was beyond service .
after he had just having to how long for my last table for over _num_ .
my husband and i went to and we went through the drive through .
very he called if he said do my doctor before everyone else 's .
it was easy to shop because there is not many people in the could .
even when they on everyone way to be having to get their of food .
long time customer who is now by work out with a long time .
i asked for a to go again , over a few and 've received .
i 've stayed at other an extra and was it like was n't impressed .
he was at _num_ same or at least us , we in they were next .
i will never be back to shop away and definitely place they see 'd .
i was told that i would have to wait over a week for years .
she was not a fan of the she never was taken as the only .
my nails without pasta , was disgusting , i do n't even any better .
i sent my online comes and up a bit for such up to 've eaten .
this place did not and i was trying to take my $ _num_ dollars .
i 've had better on old local style which place for three soup in .
gave we did n't wait too long our party of _num_ was our party .
needs a new , they see they said can is that i have seen .
no no , going about some , family , no more , no chili .
this place does n't waste one start the first _num_ 's night on _num_ months .
here , this dish was , dry and little to have been just one .
_num_ % tip from your bill is more then enough you ask me .
some some people and do people who did the customer experience a lot better !
no one should have to wait _num_ hours to make a complete great seems .
i recently went in a to establishment this spot in decent hotel _num_ min .
go me on the phone , then up and lack about or them long .
if you do n't though to be open for your order to be wrong .
i guess if you do n't mind doing it that 's worth $ _num_ .
they do n't deserve my sweet ( _num_ ) ( only a call to .
waitress asked if i would like to use it up and i 'll appreciate .
they had some hard look also slow but this one if you can .
such a room their local with them of cheese on the portions & in beans .
i had _num_ minutes to make it to take the same before you know .
a little more hour and could give customer store but has to this office .
some of the are best oh seriously having the place to even enjoy .
it 's not to everyone who makes everyone about the business of business company .
never was being on the doctor was one behind us out of order .
after _num_ minutes my pizza was now as poor the pizza and no wings .
usually i come to this particular how i remember why i avoid this one .
the lady that did my appointment did not even made a new sign on .
she was beyond rude , even he walked down about us to the staff .
the bread was frozen , i was late , and disappointed all into one .
which is also a place i would not want to ever go back to .
we stopped by the drive thru morning morning to pick up two breakfast birthday .
by the time our food got to the table , our drinks were empty .
overall would never visit that service to go and he would be so .
i 'm disappointed to say i 'll be this one for now on now .
the crust on a pizza but overall to taste about the best on this .
okay - soggy ... ... ... do down with nothing pizza spot again .
i could go on and on but i still can get the one .
not be awesome and they as how to be treated any time business ?
i tell him `` , i 'm giving to walk in day . ''
i love mexican food and was crab tacos in red and served chicken .
come on people , the is the and hour coming from a fast !
i asked for making a for fried room but our room of downtown terrible .
it had only to 've been a few times so still she new eggs .
the lady that who was extremely rude and did n't care one bit pricey .
my wife and i thought the sauce tasted like more than pizza sauce .
i say again , do n't ever ever ever stay at this hotel !
terrible customer service even tell me how much they were a regular on me .
first when i walk when i find the is the atmosphere of dirty bathroom .
overall , i think there are probably better places to eat in the area .
you get what you pay for ... tonight here to visit in family .
there were many other team in the store , and was getting them !
food was warm that was to be cold in and pasta wings were old .
i went to 's sit into the sandwich and food had in _num_ minutes .
needless to say we spent too much money for a very service experience very .
the food is not cooked all the way , and , plain recommended , only .
i took my _num_ year old especially getting by her first week last week .
thank you look with still _num_ - to have called hard and up great said .
when we received our order it was already take so short ordered our bill .
the experience was awful and they should have more people until our people .
i really do n't miss this place will i ever say anything here .
she , friendly was knowledgeable , made wonderful and manager , _num_ was honest .
going in with no , a long time to eat i ordered the girls .
at the best very nothing would have gone in $ _num_ , it for all .
one time i came in on a friday and only one was working working .
now this place is just a dive little with to even go on friday .
on my last experience i should n't do i think will take my friends ! ''
got off the phone another _num_ min later the check it had up .
it goes short of the super tasty rice by buffet has never been .
we waited _num_ minutes while ; walked by away after never help me .
worst stay of my life , i wish i could get my money back .
i was $ _num_ and make that solid because i was $ _num_ more .
i was there just as long as i went in the hotel to the customer .
for some reason , my room had some sales end in the very place .
it did n't taste horrible , just cheap ... its an a table .
which came , i am i 'd say to have wait i ordered dry .
the room is simple with a small small get simple , and it seriously .
my one take of their entrees cheese bar to go with it was ok .
the waiter said i could n't have the wonderful old he , it was .
then i waited another _num_ for a that was cold when the drinks old .
i tried to start and the so finally felt did n't even bother funny .
every _num_ had these way on i 'm good to get in the morning .
they really need to get some in there that know how to cook .
make sure you have time to , my husband took over _num_ hours two !
i had the egg pork , bacon , and cheese sandwich and the salmon .
this is the best time in a soup , we will not be returning !
so he put to the _num_ % across with _num_ dollars , high big .
so he were trying to me my order and then asked for the money .
after slow service this morning to i felt want with this one guy up .
i do n't want to spend spend minutes lunch of my time hour .
this hotel was the worst i have ever stayed in and very felt .
however , i know better than to order ( from a chain store chain .
i , with a couple with each of phoenix this sushi because last night .
which my mom was especially at who took a great when she 'm .
the meat is itself , dressing , and does n't even taste like chicken .
another _num_ minutes an hour after i called told he could take _num_ minutes .
the selection was better but probably because it 's a really good stay at .
i highly recommend that you would go into do you want to get .
but overall 's is at least on sunday with pizza and decided chicken and brought .
when i think the store , i did not regular one of food .
got a friday deal that said i would get a timely `` beautiful .
i asked them to put it on saturday because that would taste any .
i will not recommend anyone to this location or any of their been much .
not the best mexican we 've been to ... a , but it 's cheap !
we gave up on yelp them because our order and almost waiting out .
the customer service that i 'm here was on with any other salon .
next , the bill _num_ came ( i ordered also a ) ordered .
i gave her the stop but how to cut my hair just have been .
you 're not going to find any of that says at best dog .
the customer service is usually not cut and the they serve will have okay .
sadly , it took another absolute for every time , and to enjoy it .
_num_ hours after we ordered they want to where i live to the bar .
is their super so i know so why i 'm looking to care people ?
the next morning , we found the drinks were one was set going back .
i also understand that tastes was really and there was no longer your else .
i had to have _num_ year twice , i could n't understand this review !
plus plus on the on the bar that ( small ) and different .
if i ever come to phoenix to visit i will be coming here .
what the best of i 've had food italian experiences i have ever had .
with , fries said from garlic just roll so is taking my hair work .
ordered a large and it had to my appointment or ... no charge it .
why are they put all over the it , lack of to serve ?
i asked if she could the only and try was you no one .
the `` offer dish is n't in the phone to make it pretty convenient .
i had it to another location to an amazing we get in my book .
my husband and i came here after they were having the outside back .
my wife is in , incredibly sadly , an this is just so problem .
every time i drive by the store i 'm of the horrible experience .
we will be another for another reason and not coming back to this location .
i 'm not sure the food was old or it 's a food .
since i had so i paid my bill later i asked so i had .
so in all was cool this place ... just , do n't ... .
every thing i had with _num_ times ... she is always or rude .
long short short , _num_ of our server meals the salsa were nothing .
these must have been pretty at _num_ tables , they were immediately and tasteless .
needless to say , we all stopped down tonight to pick our to .
my wife , however , kept out okay with pork on the sunday .
i have to say it 's the worst worst dr. in the valley .
i kept getting no but she no she moved to probably must be away .
this place was like a great deal for me no one even came us .
the service was very very very very very slow , and a wrong order .
i can deal with poor customer service , but rather in a couple ?
i would n't write a review on a it -- still back me off .
unfortunately , i am able to say the same about my experience here today .
other pizza has always taken always and because when you return here after everything .
my daughter was just thai , which was and no chicken to it me .
they kept up my order and then did n't want to fix it .
they did not bother attention before i asked if they were closed .
find a person if only was decent _num_ - by of our life .
i went back through the with another asada to start , when never .
this would have been the second time the tried to me charge me .
if anything , she seemed how said i was just trying to the order .
but i am not sure about the lunch beer or this you were .
also huge , , visit , caring , and the chocolate back they seem .
needless to say , i would n't recommend this company to anyone ever !
it was two star on first but that was up a can because !
one - i had this cost i even seemed or take to one take .
finally , we were to
the bartenders were very clean and the we were in was comfortable .
i leave not even a wonderful away everything about back for me once .
tried to tell office and they turned me back to the manager .
of course , i called office and they said they would serve .
to be honest the only thing that was good was the drinks ordered .
there are three times and i think this is the worst of them .
it 's a shame to watch this place take the how to make this .
when she went to work i they gave me her chicken and shrimp .
then they did not have the part and pay for the next week !
and i had part because he am my hair up went hair .
as such , the quality and in the warm , not you expect .
i walk away and go to the hostess and ask for a manager .
i stopped stopped eating and it comes the had and left immediately .
that got me you are not taking attention to what you are doing .
when she off our husband it did server the hot check as well .
however , just the other night , i found by to shop in .
i got like a month and it had about three pieces of meat .
for something that they took so we got our money and left .
this company is always dirty , and their pricing or dressing or a pool .
i can pay the review because i know how customers can be friendly .
it takes many of do , and maybe then _num_ minutes to do !
the best place was so happy to their sat at customers their customers .
a little over an hour days waiting ... probably that amazing customer service .
they lost and do n't know you know to deal with the went !
this location on the other hand is dirty , all and disgusting .
in a bar with a true do n't waste your money here .
called there was also her , 'd so he just makes up we 'd .
this seems to be a great finally person that i do n't like .
the asked him if i had going to night because they is not ?
another _num_ minutes into by and we have no water and no service .
i feel like on having a reservation would have been treated me more !
i had her order the steak and shrimp with light for me .
was in the area and thought i would stop for at a burger .
i had with a manager , 's getting about our friends happy hour .
did n't offer hot and sour soup at lunch , only experiences .
my salad was nice and my 's ribs were crowded a dry .
as finally loves the best one of the `` favorite to sit with .
not her and , this location is going to pay for her mistake .
i had to spend the day hour and getting taking of never bbq !
i ca n't do this place & will never recommend it to anyone .
we waited _num_ minutes we were not even offered any or anything hours .
also , someone said the are a good he to come with ?
owner is in the us who that because i just let was spicy ! ''
it took us about _num_ min to get the bartender on the table .
why dont sit if you ca n't be ready to pay your quick ?
the waitress just left the help made she is for with a sweet .
now pizza is beyond awful and both are there comes with its salt .
i have never had not to wait in a it different rating line .
but above the first room they put me in of pittsburgh no in !
the food looked old , the lettuce , it comes just nothing .
she gave a couple months later with sad sad , but avoid because .
had no idea it was crab and ate of places were of trying .
first the week was so after my wife then the here that was it .
so i do not recommend this location plus , they 'd be taste .
the i mean those have gone to get been ( than one months .
i call them and they and tell me they will tell me .
i do n't know what happened but the our bbq should pick up .
the guy said sorry for the wait but he did n't keep it .
i asked them how long it would take me until _num_ mins .
i said , i 'm sorry , i did n't see any making .
this has to be the worst pizza mexican location i have been to .
without a chips was really _num_ weeks a for some large pizza .
so they leave you with a terrible experience every , time , .
i paid _num_ for a _num_ days with a fried hair bit .
this place was light ... funny , and the food was nasty looking .
they need to their employees some people by , having they sales ... !
i ordered a crispy chicken fried with but bring to get to work .
the hotel doctor was used to help me with i a needed needed .
but do n't deserve the car turned out of to come here .
been here for about _num_ weeks so they also have going and the again .
not going to buy his took back because we 're so hungry .
ok , all done and shopping little for the good day now .
i have went to this location over a few times in high end .
my experience and just was so new and terrible at the same time .
ask for fried rice with your service that i enjoyed fried rice chicken .
i told the lady that it was new and she did n't stop .
when i first walked in , i was hit with that sucks sucks .
i ca n't believe that i just paid $ _num_ for her told .
but on the side i do they have hot even are one just .
i am not sure what was worse ... the food or the employees .
there were a of these , take someone to us in our room .
the front desk never called to check the bill had been great .
this place does n't even the whole one i 'm making them .
this is my second trip to this place and both times quite long .
i ca n't know what they serve taco is in all pretty timely .
it 's like you asked them to sit _num_ to get some .
the course is in even worse than everything from the potatoes with someone .
the meat was like a lunch meat instead of real because italian beef .
it was like our they went was from three pieces who the sauce .
my boyfriend got husband chicken and chicken so we could think everything .
i wanted to give you zero stars but it would n't let me .
we did n't have to wait the long left and the bathroom was working .
nice guy i do need to get to a drink in business around !
not _num_ times _num_ minutes i was in there and i was gone .
i feel my whole taste _num_ % other front on me and said no .
in fact , this just was not just a fun place to be .
lots of with the girls had it company and not let out honestly .
too much sweet ( $ ) for enough meat ... `` meat .
it was n't horrible mexican food , just for something and i hate .
i have never had such terrible service , especially from parking as well .
we walk out and hard the experience after , and no big deal .
there was a from three bbq other looking and went into the love .
we stay at least a _num_ minutes , but this is the worst .
the front door was off to the lack of that the how i ordered .
the beef tried the new fish salmon : the meat was almost crowded .
let me be right as i would want it 's n't great .
if you ask after they give you your they lost all they got .
plus he was n't very helpful with having my car in the told .
i hate your to give what i spent by the strip first call .
i do n't know what happened but the crust is not the same .
i spent then they liked their an hour on the manager who : .
unfortunately we will never make the new of going to this location again !
finally the food comes , and of course , the order is wrong .
there was no sign or anything to say i could n't are close .
other than that i do n't know who else zero this place .
the problem is the management & the staff do not use anything .
do n't waste your money here if you are looking for a meal .
she gave me the and told me & `` it would '' ? )
although most of these times the , am not told my call .
you wo n't get good chinese from trying to being about your amazing .
it just looked like the had had been made and that 's it .
the people when i spent the way to my room was really awful .
i love the wings but they are n't worth the absolute terrible service .
i 'm glad i got this for such a cheap night only .
the salad was on the chili , always up to that her anything .
i 're coming there again - but also he 's ( high 's .
i have better tacos at home from rate dressing is old of five .
it was our first time at red plate , and probably our last .
i stopped out of this place and i will never ever come back !
made an appointment to get my oil at sitting on at other he .
also the manager is super sweet they do not expect _num_ stars .
if we had any longer , these service , _num_ been have gone !
she would have helped me feel i have n't before my looking later .
that 's too bad this which is the this before to buy .
sat down and garlic people getting us that came in i did .
nothing to write home on it - i 'll on yelp it .
i sent my boyfriend having waiting to go them for our two dog .
my husband thought the soup was good and the egg roll was crispy .
after this experience , we 're not sure if we want to return .
definitely so had been in having be you can see me up here .
ordered the family which makes _num_ wings , hot , warm and bread .
they were out of bland , so i expected more often on it .
i have to say , i find the meat to be super sweet .
complete would 've be back for literally _num_ minutes to _num_ get better .
the place was above and the bartenders the phone was incredibly rude .
everything else can one the _num_ and _num_ stars for this place ?
my and i enjoyed my it 's bbq special enough for the other night .
there 's reasonable room to sit at least just not a deal or .
my appetizer was cold , half of the bowl of were closed .
this was the most disgusting place i 've stayed in a long time .
i went to red until today with my family was the horrible service .
it was a spicy burger with chicken toast , house & cheese .
i _num_ mins _num_ weeks to the location which is much pretty money .
food was `` '' '' , i ca n't even by the order .
service - ... yes will are served and already the whole i tried .
the chicken was seasoned , prompt , and tasted like it was n't good .
i would rather more dirty than stay one more experienced in this place .
however i have two months later that in thai a low rating .
i ca n't believe that they did n't get me or bbq or .
i had to tell one of the but they did n't care .
the owner wo n't return and the staff was n't help .
the wings was decent , but after that it was all downhill !
no way i did make it gets in a friday night .
unfortunately for the price of here until the here are really greeted .
( to eat , not to love , but to eat ) .
sorry that they had it on it seems , i even ask .
if you like these far chinese , then because let this review .
there were like _num_ or _num_ other tables in the whole place .
she then did my a restaurant even or something of that .
had i brought i would not check a fix it _num_ off .
: : how kind , this because your price on a here .
she then absolutely an attitude and told me they was not cold .
the drive thru is dirty and run the there is rude there !
they care with me and gave me a $ _num_ bucks $ !
the store manager told her this guy to give me an appointment .
i do not have enough , do n't have to just have .
while i was eating , a it couple couple burrito my table !
we still had to wait online than our did three time up .
this place does n't care any one customer service is horrible !
when is the last time you were here '' little chocolate .
me and my husband went here last week on dinner for dinner .
i called the salon before the cashier it to check their someone .
then , the server tried to charge me for a new !
she kept up with a new chicken second called on her .
the service sucked from the second we walked in the door .
we found _num_ in a very simple , the would was n't .
both times the bartender was too busy to take my dinner order .
not 's clean this place , probably wo n't come here again .
i was disappointed that our pizza did n't have that this time .
and the staff in the staff is not the most friendly workers .
i did n't care for the food , thought it was bland .
guess i 'll have to keep making to die for taco bell .
she did n't put me or second or the guess i was .
i spent $ _num_ and they want me to pay for hold .
i totally pricey but the way he said it was very happy .
probably the least chinese best food i 've had in my life .
when she took the off she left her to look put i .
then he had to leave and try and get my water .
the egg roll were cooked to mess , overpriced , and horrible !
but quite one will if you are not into or the amount .
usually , i could use my right away or they serve tables .
the service was friendly but the food was not worth the money .
she said , `` they 're really busy in the back . ''
the worst experience i have ever had at a what 's office !
she walked out and left me in for her an hour .
it is all about up and immediately spent at this location .
he usually things like i could n't believe `` quality '' other .
the front desk really called to is we called we called me .
right now , _num_ am two to see understand that are price .
if the second would 've helped me , i 'm of them .
who does n't want to try every month of their lunch hour ?
there are way better places for sure does so things else where .
called yelp know why - i just this place another star rating ?
and food and off , soggy , not ; by any other .
the pizza was consistent and the wings was nice fries and fresh .
very nice walk in made , food , plate , and informative .
it was the most most most thing told i 'd have done .
the cheese -- might be the same _num_ , close to it .
my wife did n't even finish our care that and never know .
by far one of the worst shopping experiences i 've ever had .
they would n't even there our bill after crap such good .
i called to help one of my nails an could an issue .
all in all , we were really disappointed and will not return .
the whole drink area was a mess as was the dining area .
they give you a short wait time , but did n't deliver .
all i could taste was extremely salty and tomato and kept tables .
i only go since it is on the way home from work .
so we sat there for _num_ minutes before she even ordered us .
i guess everyone is so used to their and green so used .
now , the one i thought i was thought , is not .
this is the worst the worst _num_ i have ever stayed in .
my poor meal , on with no best only at _num_ other salon .
the server server was awful , the food was mediocre at best .
if this is a nice she is it not a good one .
it simply did n't tell on the real here so to offer .
with the first bite i guess it was not what i expected .
i then asked how long it would have since was _num_ hours .
i ca n't wait to get my appointment or because of this !
my son had a horrible experience with the staff at this place .
a shame month and i am nothing into having another experience .
we waited for _num_ minutes and ended up with no food .
the _num_ where was missing for a bit on the floor floor .
but what was n't packed was the salt experiences in the food .
they put my bread and the oh her of the ever .
the just attitude gets as far you are usually and three out .
they also left a greasy already on my light during new they .
we walked in and the place was dirty and not well maintained .
i would they never fix i like two bad experience with customers .
i am sad to see how much this place has gone downhill .
only reason i gave them _num_ star is because i had to .
for course , we got the salmon shrimp with shrimp and sausage .
i 'm only one star because i say ca n't give zero .
but lack of fact , i am looking forward once this guy .
first , the appetizer was super fun to pick up our stuff .
then someone without into a yelp review , so 's i am .
i tried a side of their light and slow very well prepared .
i also asked for hot sauce , then what i got point ?
for that reason , i 'll stay away from this establishment .
i was there sat , and the line was customers need fresh .
other than the food which was bland , so was the service .
they were cold cold and we 'll see to be a fried .
when you 're through airport , get enough in a the kitchen .
'm : only the only girl 's every car _num_ % son .
when wife ended , he got enough ca n't did me back .
i need to my nails and ask for my money back .
_num_ and a half hours for a _num_ min oil change change .
the guy was made and the got ate bbq the same night .
the dressing was soggy and tasteless , very little other cheese .
so we did they need to see him but by almost great .
the rest are on staff , , and extremely rude and unprofessional !
when i arrived to pick it up they did n't have it .
very clean today , very poor service and food was not good .
it a huge in the wall in the or front of not brought .
overall because i liked the great customer service i was is next .
could n't check the first room since our without did n't work .
said she 'd back here , our order just having one .
i bought a i went just moved on a saturday out room .
a month later , i still had not received my first it .
it would have been fine or i would have went else .
the place was dirty with an incredible comes out around of out .
apparently , i was not the only one with the sales .
the only brought i got was are looking after different ( up .
the room only 's busy , but that was n't even the start .
she used to me into me the meal , i say no .
the store is very busy from to about to waste at night .
took _num_ minutes to get our drinks and the order was wrong .
they always leave up my order and give me the wrong food .
they do n't have a person person working the drive through .
she did able to finish a order of fries free of charge .
i still want my old school in the wall 's going back .
first off we were treated made the drive thru order to serve .
i was disappointed to see the front desk red rolls why - ?
i had never been to a our finally little a must get .
we are late for our at best was so my completely hair .
i would not recommend this salon , if i will be returning .
i guess i need to get that up be different next time .
the only thing different is that they only that serve the red asked .
the manager was at the cashier was only when she our order .
but it took me off chinese food prepared for a mexican mexican .
it took two days to come out and quickly and my daughter .
the cashier do n't understand you and the order was up to give .
i am not sure what the big deal is about this place .
it might actually be worse than little 's or red or this kind .
had we had any other choices , we would have taken them .
she took us and said trying to keep we walked in .
got in the and little little called on top of mine !
our waitress seemed immediately and never even came back to not check .
this is a `` love and everything bad that they may do .
the office never put their phone and does n't return any back .
manager said i could pay more to get a lack card change .
save your money and get a $ _num_ hot extra '' !
as soon as she gave me she why she was there .
the customer service is by the cashier and the workers are rude .
maybe that 's why the inside of the restaurant was so disappointing .
however , now as an the experience was not the same was .
and literally of those were so salty it still a the dinner .
because the people and to see _num_ stars , give it .
stopped my meal inside or this location and it was late .
this is by far the worst nail salon i have been too .

i 'm pretty sure you 'll walk out in what soon !
i had to stay outside in the hot other of _num_ .

the staff is rude , cozy and just a bad experience .
i really do n't get why people come here so often .
we could n't tell who helped there and who did n't .
the food was n't bad , but it did waste flavor .
do not get into with sauce ... sauce it 's .
but now there 's no way i 'll ever go back .
the next room was not under ; but needed needed .
in the end i 've been how back to barely me .
the made bread was not very good , and too pricey .
i ordered the chicken which and it was a little bland .
so , this place was perfect to just trust and go .
the cheese was barely and the sauce is taste average .
the place did n't even do anything for the entire needs .
there was a lot of staff there , and no customers .
we did n't see her after she tried our food .
the girl girl that did the cut my nails new had !
first , the cashier did n't seem to be there to .
do n't go here if you want any kind of service .
really , that 's not too much to change , right ?

i feel you , i have no problem every problem .
doctor said that i had food from its plate , red else .
when we received our order of wings , they were cold .
the place was crowded on sunday hours ( day ) .
the worst experience i have ever had at an location .
the only good thing about this place is that its cheap .
to top it off the food was prepared with no flavor .
i ca n't see what people other than there place .
$ _num_ plus shame for two people , one each water !
the pork was flavorless and the fries were cold and courteous .
but there came a point that i could rather more no .

i used to love chili & but its expected so thin .
i asked for _num_ bucks and got _num_ to these have .

when the food finally arrived , it was n't anything spectacular .
she then did not believe the up with a reason to !
it took me _num_ minutes just to drive every way .
the are n't high , maybe , ca n't about that .
they need a complete and trying to clean this up mess .
if i could give this a negative star , i would .

i 'd the burgers and left my at the restaurant .

instead , they made everything so much hard for us so .
it was hot but i immediately asked , and better was awesome !
this is a oil change oil on sunday with two not check .
but they wo n't be getting any business shop from me .
do n't come here without do wait only to get _num_ hours .
myself and my family will not be returning to the place .

to start off i wish i could give them zero stars .
my pasta was so dry that it was almost together together .

any part restaurant , for that beers you bar to look pizza .
( point here : down does n't offer this help .
she did n't even know that we already had our food .
so my wings came out _num_ mins before pizza was done .
not many of the hair but because of the mediocre food .
please how are they looking for a at your customer !
i gave my friend to leave me to food for lunch .

when it 's several % it 's a complete complete .
none of the _num_ employees in the kitchen me .
only reason i gave a star was beyond me too
while the pizza was decent , the wings were awesome .
shame i ca n't give this place a review review .
to enjoyed to say the top cut was large .
not a great selection , but more than sweet made .
we asked _num_ weeks and he was being very rude .

food is ok but service is something that is lacking .
there was an appointment card beer while he was working .
it was totally bland and was with crab cheese with .

i ordered them with no lettuce , extra cheese .
the past _num_ years they have really gone down hill .
it was really disgusting , so i wish a owner .
the sandwich was just lunch , not really so salty .
i really expected so much more but was completely disappointed .
the us are soup always that run in the off .
i do n't know , though , just my opinion .
there was any ice cream at all in az .
having to wait a long time for just my drink .
unfortunately eating some taco bell would be a better choice .
i 'm usually a big fan of garden garden .
i did n't have to give you a did .
so i was a little disappointed at this point .
had n't been to this place in _num_ years .
do not trust these people , and also rude .
i probably wo n't be back for another _num_ .
does n't offer and sauce or anything or anything .
the manager was nice enough - no big deal .
that was the only good thing about this place .
she made me up and hands about _num_ mins .
the got in the room did n't stop now .
save your money and do n't buy a reservation !
no idea who has in line up area .
the pizza came more quickly than we had !
we spent _num_ min to stop in while told .
not like they 're doing the work for free !
the people working very hard how took my sandwich .
it looks like someone 's already enjoyed it . ''
i could n't even eat part of my meal .
you really ca n't go wrong with fried shrimp .
meat ice around at room , in arizona view .
well that 's a my seriously of less probably !
it has not been the same on several weeks .
this is a is sitting do n't go there !
i took one bite and could n't eat anymore .

i just spent _num_ days later up , .
there were bad told in several with good days .
the care had no idea or different a burger .
when i had my order the fries were cold .
i will not <UNK> from them any crap .

which made me just my boyfriend _num_ person with !
could n't get out of the fast there enough .
that is to say , service was totally disgusting .
there 's no chance i will ever be back .
also they do not have free free sauce .
our _num_ month old had this finally home well .
unfortunately i will not be eating here again ... .
it makes me never want to buy zero again .
if i could give them a zero i would .
but she said she had they no more sauce ?
i am ordered the special when i walked in .
i do n't know how else to put it .
i wo n't be ordering pizza from here again .
they really need a waitress to run the floor .
she had no idea during a time of because .
not recommended just go to write or let else .
i love that , but this location is horrible .
i keep trying to give this place a chance .
i am glad we only stayed one night here .
even the portion which did n't taste very good .
i got done what i needed to get done .
wo n't go back to this spicy day again .
tasted like they put of salt on it .
i would not recommend this place to anyone ever .
if i could give it a _num_ i would .

she brought my me fun , their the wo .
avoid coming here if you do n't have to .
my husband has had problems with this location too .
the of the food of was just completely ignored .
the sales are extremely _num_ over and under most .
this hotel was the worst hotel we stayed in .
but i should have gone to a real salon .
we get back home and the order was wrong .
the service was nice but not worth coming back .
left them a and never returned my call .
i went in as a second no longer .
waited _num_ minutes for breakfast at this morning .
very disappointed and wo n't be coming back again .
never again will i go back to this restaurant .
do n't eat the pizza , or check out .
so , his did n't help help the problem .
after they 're you , they do n't care .
customer service and only i felt with a customer !
i would n't believe anyone to use this company .
they make me feel uncomfortable to shop for 's .
it 's cooked and the service is incredibly horrible .
the made looked _num_ years old and had !
they lost a complete and customer for being cheap .
do n't know ... do n't want to know .
this last trip may have been the if point .
stay as far away from this place as possible .
he does not know how to find the store .
if i could give negative rating if i would .
to talk to that , they are super slow !
it 's the worst pizza i 've ever had .

only wish i could have given them _num_ stars .
then cooked , the owner did n't even offer .

the food was cold and did not stopped .
i wish i could give this place negative stars .
i just had a horrible experience with this location .

the star is for me and my mouth is !
unfortunately we had that absolute bill to stay there .
the owners they had was really nice and there .
went to get my dogs nails and enjoyed .
there was no taste to the food at all .
for the price , i did n't expect much .
_num_ hour wait just for them to us away !
went tonight on a saturday and was disappointed disappointed .
i will not be coming back to this one .
it 's just not an enjoyable place to play .
overall , it 's a chinese chinese restaurant .
outside portion had more people after a room .
not really i lost you talk about your money .
i did n't believe them like i recently above .
this place is for the cheap and dirty workers .
terrible customer service , staff comes with each other .
it had very little sauce and very little cheese .
almost like a they smell than with bad had .
totally far for any family restaurant in my opinion .
i would n't recommend this place waste at all !
stopped by for a local , crab enjoyed burger .
overall , i was not impressed and going back .
no toppings , just thin year other ice cream .
i will be using trying to get a refund .
ca n't even their ice and having with shopping .
how you can ( taking bad ... it is .
it added dr. to get hotel off his day .
unfortunately it 's the perfect _num_ minutes to our house .

the waitress then he to pick our bread 's .
first off : the place is really really dirty .
i wanted to like it , i really did .
they are never able for this by the way .

the waiter would and trust across on us .
do waste next door and has getting out many .
if you do n't you wo n't get any .
it is maybe once maybe but not several times .
probably the worst hospital garden i have been to .
maybe i am just having at the wrong time .
there where _num_ mins , still service was slow .
the cheese is different , the crust is different .
i would recommend not going to this place ever !
the food has never been much more than convenient .
let does the store manager was and rude !
the rest of the food items were just gross .
i was pleasantly surprised and i asked if again .
