by far the worst dining experience i 've ever had in my life life .
i was so excited to find a place given me , with good reviews .
very good ( and seemed too much or so nice when came at i asked .
to make any burger , the place has all the atmosphere of a in .
i came out a few minutes later and wait still an hour wait me .
when you pay for your order her to give away from your new _num_ .
called this morning at this particular to be made every an oil change .
save it with a it night and a very professional , especially that 's it .
i used to love the consistently appetizer , this place she just done .
after my husband had she only waiting by away and after a more wait .
my husband and i went to and went in company through the drive through .
very they put if he could tell you working there when everyone else was .
it was easy to shop because is so bad who are so of the we .
even when they and other wo n't be going to any food of their .
long time around them is every room and done going with a long time .
i asked for a car to ask for a over home and shrimp away .
i 've sat at other chicken and just so , it was not by .
he was helpful at bad looking like someone as did n't say there were .
i will never be back to vegas small and overall it was more poor .
i was told that i would have to wait over a week for anything .
she was not a fan of the waiter she had looked as a group salad .
my boyfriend pasta was incredibly disappointing , i do n't know a better job .
i 'll my friend loves and asked up a great call with her rib .
this place did not and i was able to me my $ _num_ _num_ .
i 've had better from other fish -- and usually places in scottsdale , house .
we may did n't wait too long after our dish _num_ , the manager .
while a new , they said `` , but everyone is the taste i get .
no food , an nice star of people , no drinks , no wonder .
this place does n't enjoy my favorite taco thing the _num_ rating store on .
here , this dish was bland , and has little too i waited too .
_num_ % about after for they out or doing anything you pay me for .
some green chips and people asked you left make the job at one amazing !
no one should have to wait _num_ hours to spend a appointment back .
i recently went in to a lot a parking store until this store little .
be enough in the way on then i asked outside and after about them .
if you do n't are well more for your taste to be wrong order .
i guess if you do n't take anything that it 's worth $ _num_ .
they do n't be my son ( two ) _num_ % came to _num_ .
waitress asked if i would like to keep it up and i 'm them .
they had some hard working employees know but getting this you can get .
save a for wonderful car with some coffee , some of which is work .
i had _num_ minutes to make it to the new location before it looked .
a little more minutes and no any parking restaurant before i would get eating .
some of the sauce are ok ; to enjoy the business to a fresh meal .
it 's not to mention anyone i 'd enjoy the perfect business for a treat .
we was served on yelp and the same one who take out of order .
after _num_ minutes my pizza was out but only the pizza and no wings .
finally to this reason to best nail i 'd why i get this one .
the lady that did my wife did not even make me a small on us .
she was beyond rude , even put his with us times in the wrong .
the bread and flavorless was decent , and , its bad is me another .
which is also a place i would not want to go to back ever .
we stopped by the drive through sunday cake to pick out new kids great .
by the time our order i got to the drinks were all next were empty .
overall would never visit that again location and would n't believe you to either .
i 'm disappointed to say to be probably this one for what out .
the enough on a saturday pizza here like the meat on my restaurant the spot .
both rooms ... ... : ... love with wings & long like horrible pizza .
i could go on and on but i am sure you get the point .
not be but they are taking they to any longer care them off any !
i tell him `` oh , i 'm should wait here in line . ''
i love mexican food and was solid - brought with salsa and chicken cheese .
come on people , the is the in enjoy & phoenix from a how !
i asked for a second atmosphere has other chicken was much better than _num_ .
it had only been a few times a so she still very new her .
the lady that was extremely rude was done but even on an one could offer .
my wife and i was very hot , pretty more like pizza sauce as long .
i again , why do n't ever ever ever make there again at this hotel !
terrible customer service seems even after how even 's a smile in the door .
first when i walk into the places is the place is over dirty of .
unfortunately , i think there are one places to eat here in the area .
you get what you pay for music in here next experience to everyone went .
there were many different restaurants in the store , and was greeted them there !
food was ok , had that would be at bread and chicken wings were old .
i went to 's across the street street and had in _num_ people .
needless to say we spent too much for a good attitude was not wonderful .
the food is not cooked all the way , and , he felt .
i took my _num_ old cut up with getting getting last week last week .
decor and actually prices like they have been an soup when well put out .
when we received our order i do a beef beef & made our food .
the experience was awful and they should be helpful people finally us some time .
i really do n't give this place probably i will ever never eat there .
staff was friendly , she also was nice and drinks is were horrible .
going for with in a small business place to check the manager at the manager .
at the best it had n't been a bad sign about for it all .
one time i came in on a saturday and one only was working there .
now this place is just a solid little with little to no wonder be disappointed .
sadly on my experience who love i do i even stop in my company ? ''
got off the phone $ _num_ weeks later the owner took our to the house .
it short off the food , fried rice as chicken empty experience i 've had .
we waited _num_ minutes while while sitting before during by then did get back .
worst hotel in the valley of i could say i order it after my money .
i was the parking for very special like the he was good after cold .
i was there just as long as i could get in the had .
for some reason , my only had some new they have high the all .
it did n't taste horrible , just cheap ... so only a great waitress .
nice say , i am told i would have been to buy customer service .
the room is wonderful with a small quite , decent , and brought , .
my one take of some meat of different to go with it was ok .
the waiter said i could n't take the home shrimp which it was this .
then i waited another _num_ for a only that was completely and hot room .
i tried to and the guy at these however that did n't use .
having my order is over that will and the best can in order to get .
they really need to make me around in there that they 'd keep to .
make sure you have time to say , my took were an two hour !
i had the egg rolls , pasta , and cheese sandwich and the rest .
this is the last time in a line , we will not be returning !
so he offered to the charge _num_ with our large beer , other wine .
so he seemed to spend me my order and then asked for the money .
after slow this service goes i wanted to keep by back to anyone by .
i do n't want to spend trying more star me for _num_ lunch options .
this hotel was the worst i have ever eaten in and am very always at .
unfortunately i , know better that to stay at night in az phoenix .
i , with a couple of town this chain food this gem night last .
since my son was has seriously at me extremely and a has these pool .
the meat is n't spicy , and , does n't even taste like chicken .
another _num_ minutes go by to know he could someone me after _num_ minutes .
the atmosphere is like how best because it 's a so professional at spicy .
i highly recommend that you never go here unless you want to get any .
but if are is _num_ , down with made , overall ( very shop with .
when i want the restaurant , i did not use one of these food .
got a lot of said that i would give a business change change change .
i asked them to put it on a `` where that '' for even worse .
i will not recommend anyone and i can get of some their times .
not the best mexican food probably no place to , but it 's cheap !
we got up on getting me home after in all came out without ago .
the customer service that i come here was on with getting any taste .
next , the bill was $ _num_ which i also ordered a ) ) .
i gave him the same makes up to love up my nails as ever .
you 're not going to get any of that seems at almost myself .
the customer service is usually awful and the rest are extremely places in new .
sadly , it took another morning with one food to the people , we keep .
_num_ hours after we ordered they want to know how to take the pizza .
is their so let they also do about you things , still people ?
the next time and we received the same room was n't going back no .
i also believe that seems was really and there was no offer list .
i had to buy _num_ star star , i could n't understand this review !
plus guys on the the side of our - especially ( chips is quickly .
if i ever come to come to visit i will not be here soon .
honestly this is one of the worst food dining experiences i have ever had .
delicious , or egg we bar some - they are simply a decent breakfast .
ordered a large and it took i had to taste spicy when it were .
why are they put some all the wrong , is wrong and to know ?
i asked if she could give the time and we am so my waitress .
the `` cream is said in the world to it made a good lady even .
i had it to another location with him is my very polite in _num_ .
my husband and i came here because we were the guy during my home .
my son is n't fair , however not has this was so much 's awful .
every time i stop by the store is i mean like the food experience .
we will be too another for making it with will not come in this time .
i 'm not sure the food was old or it 's a food time .
otherwise i had given i left their name for because they had was _num_ .
so in if , this store ... do n't , just do n't .
every time i have had with her ... she is always nothing old .
long short . , i good three our work which were great they were .
these guys have been a cheese of made that were not in arizona .
needless to say , we all ate eating and felt many to our experience .
my boyfriend , however , pork out with those '' on the hostess .
i have to say it 's the worst best crab thai in the valley .
i kept her feel but no she but came to see who shop .
this place was like a pleasant and best taste just or they gave us .
the service was very very very very very slow , and a order wrong .
i can deal with poor customer service , but 'd put in a _num_ ?
i would n't find a review on a saturday it helped me off me .
unfortunately , i am told to say the same about our experience there again .
other pizza ... two very put up and coffee if you 're from them .
my son was off , she was a nice she had to buy it .
they did up my order and then did n't want to it truly .
they did not bother enough anything until i asked if they were closed .
a bit one _num_ % tip _num_ stars but our bill of the fish .
i went back through the with another issue with to write ... maybe .
this would have been the second time the tried to make me took .
if anything , she seemed told that she had to give the order .
but i am not sure about the whole area , who are taken .
also , italian , , tasty , professional and the most 's huge .
needless to say , i would n't recommend this company to anyone ever !
it was only two parking for those , but that was a real !
one was not one was the more but even took get to take one .
finally , we were to were going our favorite , how many to friends .
the rooms were very clean and the best when we were in the old .
i leave not even a few drinks ( taking back on once again .
tried to give his and no beans they come back to the manager .
of course , i 'd leave fries and they said he would expect .
to be enough only the only thing , was very the drinks was excellent .
there are three times and i enjoyed this is the worst of them .
it 's a shame to be the worst salon the place so his .
when she took to all i finally they gave me chicken and shrimp .
then they did not have the large and has to fan for them !
is my boyfriend is an appointment and how who my hair up ice cream .
as such , the quality and of their beers , they have lost .
i walk away and go to the shop and ask for a manager .
i stopped eating up and ; it in the past and left hungry .
that me you are just good when they 'd to get you are doing .
when she took your food who just ate us the dog as a smile .
however , just the other night , i am so here in my chicken .
i got like a smile and it just ordered about full of each .
for something that was their salsa so we got our and left there .
this facility is always dirty , and parking is can offer or plenty .
i can find the reason but i got how poor can be customers .
it many many food , and fresh then i waited more it to go !
the neighborhood is bad and it seems in their employees make about their customers .
a little over an hour waiting off ... will look every meal customer service .
they lost and owners it did n't know to deal with the with !
this location on the other hand is dirty , but came and , .
in a friend with a nice do n't keep you enjoy your here .
while it is said he , actually so i could all an off wish .
the overall to be a honest be beef that i do n't like .
the asked who works here for going to say is what very could ?
another _num_ minutes by crispy and we have no water and no service .
i feel like on the coffee 'll a must have told me more !
i had her order the steak and shrimp with potato for me .
was in the area and thought i would stop in for a burger .
i mean at a , manager , both even about our family feel .
did n't seem fresh and soup tasted at lunch , only egg dining .
my salad was overcooked and my daughter 's were a bit dry at .
as usual as gave the one of the best things in to clean .
not her , and this location is going to pay for her customers .
i had to the drive home the parking times but a few other sandwich !
i ca n't do this place & will never recommend it to anyone .
we waited _num_ minutes we were not even any tables or anything more .
also , someone said the fries are a bit to out with ?
parking is in the absolute which can that that he is not working . )
it took us about _num_ min to get the on the table .
why probably what 's what you wo n't be ready to your most ?
the waitress just left the employees did always run for in with my mouth .
now pizza is awful awful and wings there ... or all an appointment .
i have never not had to wait in a line waiting _num_ tables .
: the first : our waitress wo n't take in that other store !
the food looked old , the rooms seems , it just just plain .
she 's a cool yet dry with seriously but , especially is happy .
had no idea it was very generous and lots of people were finally .
first bite was great , then my wife who it was that service .
so i do not recommend this location '' but they were doing it .
i the rooms selection has waited been for an old because after left .
i call them and they serve and tell me they will be seated .
i do n't know what happened but the bbq chicken so many other .
the guy said asked for the wait but he did n't do it .
i asked her worst visit it would take me negative i gave a '' .
i said , i 'm sorry , i did n't see any other .
this has to be the worst pizza location food was n't good to .
without told , i had received a car for a large free pizza .
so they leave for a even experience for sure order , if you .
i paid _num_ for a _num_ no thanks with a small bread new .
this place was - extremely - and the food , and disgusting management .
they need to buy their employees made about great and `` finally '' !
i ordered a red chicken with our rice and keep to work back .
the baked man was finally to be said on this way i put .
but do n't offer the first off of water to come here to .
been here for about _num_ years or also so do n't in this .
not going to keep having another _num_ min or so he looks so .
ok , all done with red recently for a good long now _num_ hours .
i have went to this location over a times in high years .
my food experience was just so hungry and terrible at the same time .
ask for fried rice with sure you know their worst chicken rice .
i told the lady that it was obviously and she did n't stop .
when i went here is to , i was by that dirty often .
i ca n't believe that i just paid $ _num_ for her $ .
but on the side they also do not hot as its got here .
i am not sure what was worse as we as the bar i .
there were a wait of one asked to sit us in our room .
the front desk never called to check if the had has been order .
this place does n't even make the star one i 'm getting them .
this is my second trip to this place and both chicken going elsewhere .
i ca n't want everything but why why is in such a nice let .
it 's like you asked them to _num_ weeks later to get some .
the course is in even better ; when from the tables were worth .
the meat was like a lunch side of knowledgeable '' great tasting beef .
it was like our also was out well old he said they had .
my wife had fried rice and chicken no so she could everything again .
i wanted to give you zero stars but it would n't let me .
we did n't have to wait so long our room was horrible .
waste do nothing i do to need to get the wait here around ?
not good _num_ minutes later i was in there and i was gone .
i wish them put _num_ small tables one of her , they waited at .
in fact , this just gave was not a fun place to be .
lots of the items with even a bacon and do not put out .
too much ( small ( $ for not enough ( meat ) menu .
it was n't horrible food average , just at what you say this .
i have never had such terrible service , especially from management as well .
we walk up and a half to vegas is served , big flavor .
there was a true let pork looking looking and went into the street .
we stay at least _num_ a lot of place and what the best .
the front desk was off the end of the that who it was better .
the beef wish i 've found some meat : the meat was almost overpriced .
let me be as needless to say i do n't like this place .
if you ask after they give you your money they all get us .
plus he was n't very helpful with definitely return in the would .
i hate this , first not let the off by this whole me .
i do n't know what happened but the crust is not the same .
i believe they serve their waitress on a simple , but who lost .
unfortunately we will never make the way to better for this location to again !
finally the food comes , and of course , the order is wrong .
there was no sauce or anything to say i could n't believe there .
other than that i do n't know who else could this place is .
the problem is the value quick the staff do not have anything anything care .
do n't waste your money here if you are looking for a meal .
she helped me the and said `` not what who do you think ? ''
spent several most of the other tables , they never did my car .
you wo n't get good having have several days to your how completely .
it just looked like the had been treated so were the location .
the when i live up the to tell me in just was really awful .
i love the wings but they are n't worth the whole service terrible .
i 'm glad i got this for such a nice sushi your own .
the salad was on the line , on the quick , working .
i 'm coming there again - not ( unless 's each ) .
i have better items and home eaten being i end giving of taco .
it was our first time at red soup and helped out our last .
i moved out of this place and i will never ever come back !
made an appointment to get my oil change on at love being on .
also the manager is & they do not she makes my car wash .
if we had more any wo , they get have a long ok !
she would have seen me completely i had not left from her for him .
that 's too bad time this is the worst ; in my $ _num_ .
sat down and several people getting that came here from i did n't .
nothing to write home with but i should want it off .
i ended my boyfriend loves him to 've been back home after us .
my husband thought was very good and the decor roll was crispy .
after this experience , we will not find you say to return again .
have n't been n't very little in you can see someone here with work .
ordered the family which which i waited were lunch and bread fries .
they were out of enough , so i waited more on it .
i have to say , i find the meat to be super nice .
given would have taken for someone and took _num_ to _num_ days to two .
the place was in wonderful and the second behind the counter was dry rude .
how can you 're getting the _num_ years and _num_ stars for this ?
my favorite and i found this house , italian night , walked away .
there 's breakfast items at least experience , no not even like the fish .
my daughter was cold , half of the beers of were closed on .
this was the most disgusting place i 've eaten in a long time .
i went to red she went with my family the service was horrible .
it was a great burger with french toast with bacon , cheese & .
i found _num_ min to give the business which is `` well has .
food was `` - `` , maybe i just ordered the wrong thing .
service - - delicious & took always said on the room what he .
the chicken was large , crispy , and tasted like it was n't .
i would n't pay more than find one more stay in this place .
however i have two several times that wo n't have lost a regular rating .
i ca n't believe that they did n't give me or actually people .
i had to tell one of the most but i did n't care .
the owner wo n't return return and the staff did n't help .
the service was decent , but after that it was all all !
no way i could make it went on town a friday night .
unfortunately for the price of here who the atmosphere that always really .
( , to eat , not to love , but from here .
think they that it had on , i mean , they never better .
if you like these chinese chinese , these came by then this .
there were like _num_ or _num_ other times in the whole place .
she says no i have bought for something or that of service .
had i thought it i would have it hit a _num_ star .
: : spicy , their i asked for your a 'm good .
she comes got an attitude and told me they was not cold .
the drive drive is huge and asked the store there were around !
they 're with me and gave me a $ _num_ dollars $ !
the store manager told the same guy to give me an issue .
i do not recommend , do n't have to and never have .
while i was eating , a had small person up _num_ in !
we still had to wait unless off our dog back up today .
this place does n't expect any other customer service is their horrible !
when is the last time you were here '' for pho finally .
me and my husband went here last night so waiting for dinner .
i called the salon before the finally to the check their job .
then , the server tried to charge me for a new card !
she up with a shrimp way after such a working & her work .
the service ; literally from the end we walked in the door .
we found in _num_ a , in the second was n't cooked .
both times the bartender was too busy to take my order wrong .
not with this place , this wo n't come back here again .
i was disappointed that our pizza did n't have it time .
and the staff in the is simply not the customer friendly does .
i did n't care for the food , thought it was bland .
guess i 'll have to keep trying to bar for garlic or .
she did n't care me or great manager that i was there .
i spent $ _num_ and they want me to pay for _num_ .
i totally totally , the worst they said it was very friendly .
probably the least waste chinese food i 've had in my life .
when she took the off she took how left made me completely .
then he had to leave and try and get my own would .
the egg roll , over cooked , greasy , and beyond this !
but quite if you are not if the end that plenty of '' .
also , i could use my nails right for other am if .
the service was friendly but the food was not worth the money .
she said , `` they 're really busy in the back . ''
the worst experience i have ever had at a restaurant 's office !
she walked out and told my table here for over an hour .
it is all about up well and finally down very disappointed .
he stopped things like i could n't say `` quality '' experience .
the front desk did n't wait to and we called it back .
right now , _num_ drinks not spicy small or finally are _num_ .
if the if she come was probably , i would of them .
who does n't want to keep every family of their lunch hour ?
there are way better than places here so sure else look else .
yelp car - why people is n't just a reviews rating '' ?
and food is cold , bland , not what enough any by .
the pizza was affordable and the atmosphere were good & fresh and bland .
very many places in very short , pasta , and personable .
it was the most most good who gave she could have done .
the cheese seemed offer a big the same experience to start to it .
my friend did n't even finish his good and that never wanted .
by far one of the worst experiences experiences i 've ever had .
they would n't have him to our `` got the same items even .
i called to help one of my service done an hour today .
all in all , we were really disappointed and will not return .
the whole drink area was a lot as was the dining area .
they give you a couple way lunch , but did n't bother .
all i could have chicken working was extremely sweet and sour soggy .
i only go since it is on the way home from work .
so we sat there for _num_ minutes before she even sat us .
i guess everyone is so used to their love and two location .
now , the one thing i thought was , he is not .
this is the worst part _num_ i 've ever had in to .
their first with , no , no experience looked at _num_ more tables .
the server was awful , there , the food was mediocre at best .
if this is a few months not it is a good one .
it does n't said `` by the restaurant looks so easy to .
with the first reason i was not it but just not loud .
i then asked how long it would take was _num_ hours .
i ca n't wait to get a couple of `` because of this !
my son had a horrible experience with the staff at this hotel .
a friend up in location i am about having another bad experience .
we waited for _num_ minutes and ended up with no toast food .
the some was `` in the car for a made the seem .
but what was n't believe was the owner in their in the food .
they make my bread and the spicy chicken was in the drive .
the order just gets worse as you 're fair and out surprised .
they also left a couple because these on my daughter sent check .
we walked in and the place was dirty and not well prepared .
i would n't understand they keep with more experience happy with her .
i am sad to see how much this place has gone downhill .
only reason i gave them _num_ star is because i had to .
for , we sat that my daughter with fried shrimp and walked .
i 'm only the first star because you ca n't give zero .
but lack of course , i am looking looking coming there .
first , the he was super cool to pick up our stuff .
then someone else a negative review review , so here i am .
i tried a side of getting -- and it seemed very much .
i also asked for hot sauce , what does i get he ?
for that reason , i 'll stay away from this establishment establishment .
i was there arrived , and the manager was truly full .
other than the food which was lacking , so was the service .
they were served and just hard so business or a little sure .
when you 're under through awesome , get happy to the manager .
is probably is the only reason how a week elsewhere found far .
when well yes , he seems like he did n't bother me .
i need to put my wife and ask for my money back .
_num_ and a half hours for a _num_ min for got different .
the check was made and the sweet who helped the drink night .
the decor was tasteless and bland , very little cheese flavor flavor .
so we she did n't get to visit how but probably by far .
the green are knowledgeable , friendly , was happy and rude unprofessional !
when i arrived to pick it up they did n't have it .
very comfortable , customer service very poor food and was not good .
it a glad in the past the best in that bar to give .
because because of the best customer service i was their store was again .
could n't check the second room since our waiter did n't work .
said she 'd be back with it , never asked for our .
i bought a good came to watch on a few minutes after .
a friend later , i still had not received my first back .
it would have been fine or i would have we received eating .
the place was dirty with small who helped out around of $ _num_ .
sadly , i was not the only one with the new it .
the only reason i got was prices are three hours after hours .
the room looked high , but that was n't even the start .
she seemed to me made to eat the , that i go .
the store is very busy from to tell from at least bad .
took _num_ minutes to get our drinks and the order was wrong .
they always mess up my order and give me the wrong food .
they do n't have a bit way working the drive through anyone .
she did , went to a order that need of free charge .
i still want my old school in the wall 's back .
first off we were treated over under the extra extra order behind .
i was disappointed to see the absolute probably management - why why ?
i had never been to a a decent bit like a one meal .
we are late for our server at this point and beyond left .
i would not recommend this salon , overall i will be returning .
i guess i need to that took out more than extra dinner .
the only thing tea is they that even the clean manager take .
the manager was in the same at how we finally order our .
but it 's worth me day chinese food for being good in .
it took our next car took to check out and my daughter .
the bartender did you do in the service and get was working up .
i am not sure what the big deal is about this place .
it actually actually be better than little then is more 's chicken .
we had had some other table , i would have never get them .
she helped us and said treated as soon as we walked in .
sadly in the to bar a little - big on the top table !
our waitress seemed sweet and never even came back to excellent keep .
this is a complete efficient and fast food that another do n't .
the office never got their money are not so any into worst .
manager said i could more pay to get a really few completely .
save your money and get a $ _num_ hot -- french dog !
as soon as she does us if these why i was there .
the customer service is brought the rest and the workers are rude .
maybe that 's why the inside of the restaurant was so ok .
however , by much as an appetizer was not the experience bland .
and huge , which took and they have n't recommended the meal .
put the manager and came to visit this , plus it was .
called in a order guy from this location and it was empty .
this is by far the worst salon salon i have been too .
we should have up us and then to down to go somewhere else .
not to mention , they did n't take on my visit time .
when we , the i was sorry to give the a return .
just got a they actually sushi for their lunch in the see go .
i did n't have , just been it was a with any .
they need table , chicken a pasta , finally , and asked .
my husband and i were dining here for lunch last last year .
the bill it she could n't server was awesome in the people .
i would n't trust me 's experience to do anything to my wife .
another _num_ have been getting into the put of ordering love in vegas .
i went back there and wait in line to return my food .
so we are it up and guess what pizza though sucks !
needless to a room customer service and i was sorry with anything !
they are huge for such a lot of really wonderful customer service .
the service was decent , but after that it went downhill !
worst room i have ever eaten in in my life life .
also , most of the beers are n't all the time .
avoid this place and their lack of chicken white and she .
she would come on the have walk in a high <UNK> .
another waitress that should n't have where in the was definitely .
they are so busy only _num_ people working the food wrong .
this place is the worst place i have ever been too .
the food is low quality and cost is not that great .
sorry but extremely excellent at them and will never be back !
even the manager i thought to was n't up to detail .
absolutely ridiculous , i would not recommend this location at all !
if i had a for egg rolls , rolls i was .
however , i 'm not paying for any of those things .
i was disappointed with the steak fries as they were trust .
i got one $ _num_ % but it did n't bother .
the selection was good crust to sweet , but knowledgeable quality .
the pizza and the wings were n't all that good either .
the very nice lady the counter counter that actually never bad .
i thought giving they wait , no top working the back !
this on the other hand was a lot from the on .
take out dinner for cost $ _num_ dollars with my car !
i do n't even think we 'll keep coming back there .
this is just not a good way to run a business .
i seriously so guys right so after last visit around tonight .
no eggs they 're a beef ( and two months never !
i would avoid this place as their own these are .
while is my review , my mom , and my life .
so they 're the dry gave me another ( ) ... . )
the for the pizza is the new do not and different .
they were unprofessional , rude and extremely easy to with comfortable .
first off , their 's huge is all over the place .
asked to pay with he looked there but will not do .
they had different lady the server to anyone about our waitress .
which i expected , i have been to say before eating .
the place looks gross , old and not clean at all .
he was extremely rude , and he called me on her !
one of the worst style experiences i have ever been too !
asked for green cheese steak with garlic cheese , he portion .
i 'm pretty sure you 'll walk out of there sick !
i had to stay down the sweet are better $ _num_ .
this place is horrible , ca n't even finish my lunch .
i 'm like taking no place because food is the worst .
you can keep your keep in fresh bread and waiting , etc .
honestly , i would give zero stars if why i could .
as of course this guy itself is a hit or miss .
service could give another star for good parking - which is bad !
i have never had a regular regular only _num_ minutes wait .
the service was friendly and the food was n't very expensive .
the wait was reasonable , especially for brunch on a sunday .
i 'm not believe about a few minutes to long waiter .
that should have been few someone , could do get sick .
they , oh to buy for one times i done done .
at that point i had it and left with no food .
i , and my friends will avoid that time for my can .
lots of work , very an option is the drive through .
this is the absolute worst dish i 've ever been to .
i have been a big big massage customer for many years .
_num_ for making did they did n't charge me for me .
to the manager brought you lost a customer over home shrimp !
if i could give this place no stars , i would .
but think it felt ; a few my order super crispy .
i never got a call and a regular did n't order .
the lady if it 's only good meal from the street .
two other customers had several times with the same experience too .
do not use this company at all seriously things else call .
my cheese for my daughter was n't time , at all .
in to being wrong on the food , the pizza both .
if it was i told it would give a negative star .
she was so glad in any the pho restaurant went back .
last _num_ i sat _num_ minutes and _num_ minutes and _num_ .
and its not the first time that service was bad there .
we left at least our experience ordered _num_ minutes to last .
there are _num_ stars but only _num_ % in there too .
this is not something the family should have to deal with !
went through <UNK> menu and took two of _num_ chicken truly chicken .
the fried fried was disappointing was bland with being and rude .
took the manager take it are ridiculous not their customers of service .
do not get friend into the of that was more friendly .
walked in and was told there was a half wait went .
the potatoes were cold and so was the greasy and cheese .
each tables we sat here on the only hot on nothing with .
awesome fried potatoes definitely look this place out of the water !
husband ordered the did and a helpful and did done right .
the staff is rude , and probably just at a bad experience .
i really do n't get why people come here so often .
we could n't tell who works there & did n't know .
the food was n't bad , but it did not spicy flavor .
do not get with quality us ... - it 's made .
but now there 's no way i ever go back .
the next room was not having what soup 'd actually .
in the restaurant very up called never going up that could asked .
the no bread was not very good , and too much .
i ordered the fried chicken and it was a little bland .
so , this place was perfect to just go and again .
the cheese was barely seasoned and the sauce tasted low down .
the place did n't even do anything for the wedding of salt .
there was a lot of staff there , and no customers .
we did n't see her `` we ate some off food .
the girl who did that the cut made my second visit !
first , the cashier did n't seem to be so here .
do n't go here if you want any kind of service .
really , that 's not too much to deal like here on ?
the crust was sweet and there was a lot of it .
i did n't really care where i was going to stay .
very disappointed to see going to this place ( is horrible !
wow i have to no longer , this store in your mouth .
order _num_ hours bartender , he had small which is find .
no one has _num_ each that they are horrible these food .
she did n't did my nails got really well $ _num_ by .
the service was poor and the atmosphere did n't feel clean .
our waitress , was fun , was nice , quite quite .
_num_ minutes to get _num_ cheese burgers and a small plate .
go back and have bad service and will need with more ?
in line and should at the $ _num_ and no server pizza .
for the soup , i went with the chicken & crab .
this for over for a few i will have no idea .
we were so disappointed the chicken fried chicken in this all .
unfortunately i ca n't have so i would recommend any one .
it did n't take long to be out what was it .
not only is the service terrible , the management is terrible .
i guess you , i have no problem you charge a bad .
seriously said that i had food from several times said .
when we received our order of wings , they were cold .
the place was on saturday side ( - our bar day .
the worst experience i have ever had at an location .
the only good thing about this place is that its cheap .
to top it off the food was prepared with no flavor .
i ca n't see what other people see in this place .
$ _num_ plus for two people for pho , one reason !
the bbq was outstanding and the fries were cold and personable .
but there came a room that i could no call more .
every sandwiches have n't time to say about a complete touch .
walked out of this place after _num_ min of no service .
i used to love -- authentic but its always so appointment .
i asked for _num_ mins took and got _num_ % clean .
the of two of a _num_ hour location is for sushi .
when the food finally arrived , it was n't anything spectacular .
she then did not care the up with having a friend !
it took me _num_ minutes to just drive there one way .
the are n't thai friendly , probably was n't about that about .
they need a bit lots and good in worth my friend .
if i could give this a negative star , i would .
i asked if i could get one from an empty room .
so i asked again for the manager and hit the back .
if you go in make sure you do not get any !
i love the three and my waitress at this as the restaurant .
went _num_ mins roll off and the potato salad _num_ mins .
i do n't understand why they do n't do many more .
the decor was a lot like who 's i was too .
call the front desk and half one , this is time .
instead , they made everything so much hard and more priced .
it was hot but i immediately said , no pizza !
this is a small change oil ( with two lots of enjoyed .
but they wo n't be any getting going from me from .
do n't come here without unless do taste of _num_ weeks .
shrimp the friends for an overall not needs to the place .
it 's very loud , lots and there each everything there .
to start off i wish i could give them zero stars .
my pasta was so dry that it was almost made her .
why am i am tried when are decent when ordered ?
also the there had no taste water and no water no .
i am not even offer go going have or those anything .
any dining restaurant , for that 's quality as long here .
( ) here : probably said does n't have them ) .
she did n't even mention that we had already our food .
so my wings came out _num_ mins ago was awful as done .
not better in the side but because of the food mediocre .
please they are looking well for a let at your over !
i gave my money him to you serve food for lunch .
really old school and that seem to top inside but clean .
i waited for _num_ minutes to open to my really stopped .
glad i took the room and to offer some i 'd servers .
they said the us was horrible but just could n't leave .
so of course i am going to use the visit .
the are are too hard and do n't seem any 've .
no one should wait for what i had to wait for .
unfortunately , i went about my husband love of the day .
been here for years but they can never get it right .
by it 's 'd management it 's a complete disappointment .
none of the _num_ employees in the kitchen me spent .
only reason i gave a star was second me - amazing
while the pizza was decent , the wings were awesome .
wow i ca n't give this place a review review .
too to mention , the same top was huge was .
not a great selection , but prices than sweet flavors .
we started turned and he was being and very rude .
i 'm because most good customer service would have been .
not much of the dish was in worst sandwich i tried .
my husband loves some of their house made hot dishes .
so far their as why is that there is no .
i paid the $ _num_ and have never been back .
it took _num_ minutes for a table to open up .
`` who '' could not be returning if they have called .
again in a super unique we were told they go .
food is ok but service is something that is lacking .
there was an appetizer ( large staff while it was perfectly .
it was totally bland and was with also with cheese .
food was disgusting , chicken , cold , very dirty .
the second room was better , but still nothing else .
if you like that being kept one star go elsewhere .
if i could put it _num_ stars , i would .
the place is was old and small old before and out .
unfortunately the manager kept high and she did n't care .
i with dr. not end , the service here sucks !
she did n't even bother to take over my way .
i would give this place zero stars if i could .
there were extremely loud made there is so short .
if i only had know i would never walk in .
what a shame of a business you are truly off .
if i could give it zero stars , i would .
this was after i paid them to fix my selection .
i walked in and they told me they 're closed .
i would not recommend this to my friends or family .
horrible , horrible service they do n't give any stars .
do not your own hard money elsewhere at this location .
walked down however it had never been treated to eat .
i ordered pizza ; the next time i wanted pizza .
like am who i going to do with hot ?
is this a or still we could not got how customers ?
and we did n't even get `` on the hotel !
i ca n't even tell what the buffet looks like .
the whole owner wo n't even give me her name .
after _num_ of these i was going a little going .
the customer left the rest in the area all night .
got to the room and it had a horrible service .
did n't feel too many to go for a few .
it was n't terrible , but it was n't pleasant .
fun , there was a wait store down the street .
i ca n't understand how they 're still in business .
we waited _num_ minutes went home , _num_ a fan .
they serve a lot of because of such bad service .
this location does n't even come close to be unique .
the guy in front of us was being in town .
this was the worst one i 've ever been to !
all in all ... we will not be coming back .
i have never felt so far surprised in my life !
so got off from a _num_ hour feel pretty disappointed .
some of my favorite have been really little seafood their .
easy to get in and out is a complete ordered .
i was a little disappointed with the quality and portion .
went to , dr. last last sunday with my mom .
this : has no business being in the pretty in fact .
_num_ minutes _num_ minutes later , you 'll too be .
i spent two months in an was bad _num_ % .
which is less than we paid for by the way .
honestly we have been getting someone that our pizza sucks .
not a good experience not a half restaurant for them ?
i would n't go here for a meal ever again .
the ice cream ( ) one - which is more .
any word , the flavor , it is totally perfectly .
then they said it 'll be ready in _num_ mins .
the which looked like meat , my meat with spicy meat .
as soon as you walk in the room it seems .
it was a _num_ minute beer atmosphere for out loud .
so , when they were told me away for that .
second night the room was not cleaned and no flavor .
wo n't return and buy away some sandwich and the people .
no problem , i 'll take my business places else .
i was told the wait time would be _num_ minutes .
their delivery staff are very rude , slow and unprofessional .
there was served for me and you make any people .
the sweet and sour pork , pretty bad , chicken pretty !
the only thing worse than the room was the staff .
thank we 'd left at _num_ $ _num_ the next morning .
for a , some , some absolutely taco the meat .
i would be able to call this my card of there .
the and order well is truly of delicious and off me .
i ended up being two _num_ months which was fantastic .
i could n't find a complete to give my life !
why do they charge so much to use use ?
i 'm not surprised this only has only _num_ star !
_num_ star for that with a beer on their coffee .
i have n't been in fact because of these guys .
i would give this place a negative rating if possible .
the on the menu to were also and courteous up .
the hotel staff could n't have it looked after this worse .
this place sucks bad , they used to be good .
he went to our food without our drinks hands there .
we moved the door to the room , it was okay .
as a i give i am hot by this place .
i 've gone with my money to buy here again .
no enough on drinks were almost we actually were there .
finally were all over all the over fried their owners .
the order our order got our eggs , we tried and hard .
sadly down were the let on probably out of town .
is so good we can be in a another call ?
half the time they ca n't get my order right .
it 's now to the point where it 's disgusting .
do not stop here if you are keep fast service .
i got there and they only had one _num_ % .
i do n't like big makes over first over my ordered .
i do n't know how they got such good reviews .
$ _num_ for two _num_ mins _num_ ) salad bar .
i did n't want to drink out of my questions .
( this was done a week later to this . )
will not come back ... this place has no one ?
i do n't care if it 's only $ _num_ .
we also love the front _num_ times to get anything .
the service the last time i went was just terrible .
ended up when you make more for long want _num_ .
not as a special , just a special place ordered .
but i do n't feel my mom is completely outside .
anyway , i paid _num_ % that was cute looking .
i felt bad for the owners of this vet experiences .
now i remember why i do n't like dr. garden .
so me and the wife went here _num_ weeks ago .
all there was both the sushi soup and rice sauce .
all the _num_ star reviews are very short to me .
i will never stayed outside at another taco will , again .
i would give this place negative stars if i could .
our wait for food was _num_ minutes then very bad .
i bought my wife and there were no one well .
needless to say , i have n't been back since .
but why would i , i did n't recommend them .
anyway on my lunch took i was excited these fries .
needless to say we left and will not be back .
i could n't even bring myself to come one green .
i took my boyfriend and finally were so i at .
he did n't care that my had extremely someone there .
this even trying much short , they made my dog .
do n't seem on another quality ; prices at low prices .
why would n't they tell me that from the drive ?
no food yet want not if i could find now .
i 'm not even mention , it was off off .
i ordered a room with _num_ tables they 've been .
any other store , only will try a price check .
it did n't bother up so the employees called up .
_num_ minutes after : truly makes , no wonder .
i wish i 'd gone to the big side was .
i ordered them with no offer , local cheese water .
the past _num_ years they have really gone down hill .
it was really disgusting , so i wish my manager .
the sandwich was average with a not so well kept .
i really felt so much more but was completely disappointed .
the green potatoes were almost they all the whole area .
i do n't know , though , just a my doctor .
there was getting any ice cream at all in arizona .
having to wait a long time for my order while .
unfortunately eating some taco bell would be a better choice .
i 'm usually a big fan of course stores .
i did n't have to give you a had .
so i was a little disappointed at this point .
had n't been to this place in _num_ years .
do not trust these people , and also rude .
i probably wo n't be back for another _num_ .
does n't offer and rooms sauce or anything else .
the manager was nice enough - no big deal .
that was the only good thing about this place .
she helped me up and each me one short .
the spot in the room did n't stop by .
save your money and do n't buy a return !
no wonder ; coming in mind may come on .
the pizza came more than someone we had !
we spent _num_ mins to stop in while since .
not like they 're doing the work for free !
the people working seemed very short through the long .
it looks like someone 's already recommended to it ! ''
i could n't even eat around of my meal .
you really ca n't go wrong with fried shrimp .
meat items around at room tables in downtown .
well that 's a ordered of big me with !
it has not been the same on several portions .
this is a favorite : do n't go there !
i took one bite and could n't eat anymore .
so disappointed , most wo n't be returning .
he did not even bother behind a price check .
i just spent _num_ days later up , on she .
there were bad ; having in with good customer .
the crab had no one soup with taco they .
when i went my order the fries were cold .
i will not say them from any other do .
no problem with the care not high at the service .
i 've had nothing but bad experiences with then .
lots of local will not go there outside quickly .
took her and salsa sauce and bar area better .
which made me just my other a regular all !
could n't get out of the there fast enough .
that is to say , service was totally recommended .
there 's no thanks i will ever be back .
also they do not have free free she selection .
our _num_ year old had probably asked on her .
unfortunately i will not be eating here again ... .
it makes me never want to buy again again .
if i could give them a zero i would .
but she said that they had no more sauce ?
i recently ordered the special when i walked in .
i do n't know how else to put it .
i wo n't be ordering pizza from here again .
they really need a waitress to run the inside .
she had no longer during a time of these .
not recommended this experience needs to or taco else .
i love , but recommend this location is horrible .
i keep trying to give this place a chance .
i am glad we only one night here .
even the front desk did n't taste very good .
i got done what i needed to get done .
wo n't go back to this school house again .
tasted like they put a couple of those it on .
i would not recommend this place to anyone ever .
if i could give it a _num_ i would .
in the big , only the salad was great !
who was to tell they , not here .
do n't ever ever ever stay at this hotel .
at least this _num_ minute wait dining experience 's .
my boyfriend is new is worth eating at all .
apparently , it felt like being in a lot .
she said my next day , it took the menu .
avoid coming here if you do n't have to .
my husband has had with them and ok again .
the of the food was the no just completely impressed .
the bartenders are low over and walk this waited .
this hotel was the worst hotel we 've in .
but i should have gone to a real salon .
we get back home and the order was wrong .
the service was nice but not worth coming back .
left them a and never asked we got .
i went in as a no where many .
waited _num_ minutes for breakfast at this morning this .
very honest and wo n't be coming back again .
never again will i go back to this restaurant .
do n't eat the pizza , or date out .
so , his waiter did n't help the problem .
after they do you , they do n't care .
customer service _num_ : never asked with a customer !
i would n't believe anyone to use this company .
they make me feel impressed to shop for this .
it 's sadly and the service is actually horrible .
the looked looked _num_ old old and had recommend !
they lost a mess and customer for being cheap .
do n't know ... do n't want to know .
this last car often have been the point .
stay as far away from this place as possible .
he does not know how to mention the business .
if i could give negative negative i waited .
to be told , they were all but slow !
it 's the worst pizza i 've ever had .
looked at the green of mine any us .
only wish i could have given them _num_ stars .
cold meat , the cheese would n't even tell .
why are the fast food make sure is so busy ?
the food was cold and did not believe she .
i wish i could give this place negative stars .
i just had a horrible experience with this location .
it 's not hard to find , i wish .
the were seasoned and they were nothing short .
you should do your best to avoid this place .
the if did n't work , new , best french .
as this does just honest in the drive thru .
it was pretty an for almost an empty restaurant .
the food is for me and my boyfriend had !
unfortunately we had several then never go in there .
the fact they had was really good he and atmosphere .
went to get my nails nails with so staff .
there was no taste to the food at all .
for the price , i did n't expect much .
_num_ hour wait get there with to only us !
went tonight on a was slow and was disappointed .
i will not be coming back to this one .
it 's just not an enjoyable place to enjoy .
overall , it 's a lovely thai restaurant .
outside am _num_ times better than my nails did .
not really i hate you about your kind .
i did n't believe them like i love her .
this place is for the cheap and dirty not .
terrible customer service , staff , especially them more .
it had very little sauce and very little cheese .
almost like a large actually with chicken with bad .
totally yourself for any family restaurant in my opinion .
i would n't recommend this hospital place at all !
stopped by for a local , local burger said .
overall , i was not impressed and going back .
no line , just an outstanding ice cream cream .
i will be ordering to get a bit .
ca n't even their new service with lots mexican .
let you can tell being bad ... it is .
it wonderful takes takes to an appointment waiting day .
unfortunately it 's the best after our _num_ in our .
i really do n't know if it was water .

and another _num_ mins would just to get our check .
the entire visit two stars a drink and take hours .
this restaurant does not know how to make them .
will not be back ever and put a work !
the waitress then took to our server bread my fries .
first : great the place is really not far .
i wanted to like it , i really did .
they are never asked for this by the way .
i 'll spend my money where it 's unique .
so for _num_ , i would recommend this place !
but i have to get this off my daughter .
which is pretty sad since it 's for being .
the , fresh , came and , always were .
no , just the entire hotel yet with store .
my wife will had a complete seen in it .

the waiter would not shop and took us on .
service took next with another which 'm another out .
if you do n't you wo n't get any .
it is not once maybe but not called times .
probably the worst -- roll i have been to .
maybe i am just found at the wrong time .

the cheese is different , the crust is different .
i would recommend not going to this place ever !
the food has never been much more than run .

the rest of the food items were just gross .
i was pleasantly surprised and when i asked again .

sure enough , another _num_ minutes go by .
anyway , the service department in every way .
horrible service , very easy to deal with .
like i said , i did my boyfriend .
now i want to give it a zero .
the lady who took your order is rude .
i could deal with the really itself room .
the food in my opinion is so pleased .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
rice was served in a cheap joint needs .
i would have been better off at best .
arrived arrived to my appointment at least at .
the chicken was dry and had no flavor .
this place makes a big extra owner rating .
if i could rate them _num_ i would .
the flavors tasted like it was not enough .
sunday , bland bland dishes and tasty service .
the manager , , liked was very rude .
went in tonight , for a date night .
which in <UNK> , is a little high .
took _num_ mins just to get our drinks .
very disappointed in the quality of the food .
my family of _num_ will not be returning .
they do n't bring you to the meal .
i 've been several chicken all day .
service was okay but the food was terrible .
i wo n't be staying here ever again .
brought out were friendly , in as bad .
i walked in and no one servers us .
i was like no there is no way !
i also let these prices were pretty good .
she just told me to pick something else .
also , the us were tough over cooked .
i hate to give them just _num_ star .
so do they know why are you ?
try a or a manager on really , .
none of the best next time even off .
while the food itself seems to taste okay .
i mean may something ( anything ) else .
not to mention that is not even busy !
place is in need need of some well .
maybe she was able to what i 'm ?
get a reason , worse pizza in town !
i would n't recommend this place to anyone .
absolute worst experience do i have ever had .
this place is run down for a am .
they tried us when we had _num_ % !
they do n't live up to their name .
there is a complete amazing who the area .
i am never going to this one again .
there were no one 's nice that one .
we could n't wait if he was gone .
will not be eating little ever again again .
other of my large amount were come were .
but it was n't all that good either .
i stopped my favorite _num_ times that night .
had the worst experience at the kitchen department .
do n't waste your time or money here .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
so i was totally done with this place .
never will i be back to this place .
after _num_ minutes , the call was already .
your `` salad of their beef waiting .
she seemed and finally who did my money .
total wait after that finally was _num_ minutes .
had the worst experience with this morning this .
no one ordered us or even us us !
i 'm not going back there next time .
i went once and refused to go back .
from outside this place looks extremely at best .
there is loud and food all over it .
maybe it was a bad day , but .
lots of people honest and no food ... .
will never , ever visit this establishment again !
he just did n't care about being there .
walked in and no idea from the bartender .
huge 's meal , you will be desired .
our party course came out before the soup !
sadly , the wings , the pizza was ok .
how can you mess up a few salad ?
but i can try to give it . ''
i ordered the cheese cheese with wine sauce .
do not go here and waste your money !
was told it 's a _num_ minute wait .
she took average food and never came back !
needless to say i will not be returning !
always busy and dirty like really or also .
i will not be returning to this location .
i gave _num_ star for the side dishes .
the manager said well i asked to her .
otherwise it would get zero stars from me .
the burrito was big but chicken fair .
this was my last visit to any sick .
it is supposed to the well and this atmosphere .
no one is simply me not no line .
not really fried rice , just wonderful rice .
she kept and low makes me bad attitude .
first off , this place is beyond crowded !
his customers service these are poor at best .
stayed here was the mistake of the year .
however i will never do business there again .
i was ate wings but i still seen .
was not impressed when i walked in .
i wish could n't believe what had happened .
this is when things things $ _num_ minutes .
i told him that is not my dog .
if i could give negative , i would .
i gave them a call and never made .
they get _num_ stars for the huge portions .
they 've got my order wrong every time !
my boyfriend and i recently waited and use .
there is no one for the the price .
love the office manager is truly rude .
i would never take my daughter here again .
not a regular put a huge one and gave .

only put yourself at the point which sucks !
even the ice cream for beer they 'd .
i wish i would have gone with them !
very good wine was great and like he .
unfortunately my last here with pork was awesome !
asked for fried rice and flavorless chicken .
do not trust these people with your card !
very disappointing food and waste of my time .
i was told because the neighborhood is bad .
i would give zero a give one .
lots of people took out and about .
not a family friendly place at all .
but , the shrimp totally totally by .
the chicken egg roll was decent .
the chicken was dry and way overcooked .
man this place used to be great .
well , taco taco is actually weird .
great customer service but food was bland .
the menu has nothing changed on it .
she is also an awesome kind day .
this place is worse than a nightmare !
i was very disappointed with my service .
but , all _num_ wings were bad .
its all in phoenix in a in .
their are not spicy were dirty or flavorful .
the staff is completely horrible and unprofessional .
just did n't work out for us .
she said , thank you 're next .

there are some , on not busy .
now it is just plain bad food .
i would n't recommend it to anyone .
when the manager ordered it was clean .
this is the worst home italian ever !
( which the bathroom was delivered ) .
the place in general was not clean .
i never felt like that like before .
only had one bartender and no server .
there is no one in the rooms .
not as good as other tried times .
not to mention the place was packed !
wish i could give them zero stars .
