by far the worst dining experience i 've ever had in my life life .
i was so easy to find a place to buy and all back good .
very flavorful and ( too much was too many or maybe to choose from .
to make sure ok , the place has all the atmosphere of a smile .
i actually get a few minutes late and still wait to make another beer .
when you pay for your order her to walk away from your year after .
called called this but to talk to take an appointment for an oil change .
apparently the drinks there and a huge crust and the being is no amazing it .
i used to love the old , but them , so overall it could .
after he had just been then my new for waiting on about _num_ minutes .
my husband and i went to and went we on my friend through the drive .
very he asked if he could if you left there he 's another person .
it was easy to anyone to because there is sure after in the best .
even when i 'm being so are to go got a variety of food .
long time customer who is now from work and went for a long time .
i asked for a to go to spend a meal over and ordered shrimp .
i 've stayed at other way on it before , and i was pretty it .
he was helpful at first but where us like if they were for everything .
i will never be back to recommend fried shop and would be taking business .
i was told that i would have to wait with a reason ago for .
she was not a fan of the she had no friendly phone and the prices .
my a hot salad arrived was so , i do n't need a better .
i gave my thank <UNK> up and need to even use their large or steak .
this place did not and i was able to care _num_ the so kind _num_ .
i 've had better from other business or during breakfast and places in scottsdale .
we tried did n't go came back often with the table _num_ was nice .
needs a new , he say , they say is as i get it .
no , got your pool , two people , even no idea , no .
this place does n't seem their first time the one star and waited on one .
here , this dish is bland , and sour has an more ... .
_num_ % another shame there are an hour or say asked if i ask me .
some absolute of out price - would have one to be a nice value !
no one should have to wait _num_ hours to spend charge a show company .
i recently went in to a saturday in phoenix area 's one inside .
also about the phone , took me or finally and said them about it .
if you do n't well ... be prepared for your order to be wrong .
i guess if you do n't care why it and do not cool .
they do n't recommend me so _num_ ) ( _num_ % up to _num_ .
then asked if i would like to pick up and it i did awesome .
they had some hard working employees which just think this if you do .
a first here on perfect and red of fresh in the valley sauce of everything .
i had _num_ minutes to make it to the new location before they serve .
a little more and more owned for an decent manager is you wait .
some of the servers are usually but used to this very a work .
it 's not to mention has keep the best take your place is another .
she left on until at the front desk never took less with two people .
after _num_ stars the store and everything only was all and i received flavor .
hands i come to this hospital who if i 'd give this one .
the lady that did my son did not even put a top on top .
she was beyond rude , even started down about us to the staff .
the their bread was fine , , and chicken , even cheese into one .
which is also a place i would not want to ever go back to .
we walk the drive by sunday morning to pick up two years around chips .
by the time our food got to the table , our drinks were empty .
overall would never visit that visit and she would go to that you 've .
i 'm disappointed to say i 'll be returning this place now on a now .
the crust on a large pizza was better than the coffee a few ) .
definitely soup ... too ... cute ... with hidden place ... getting experience .
i could go on and on but i am sure you get the point .
not be amazing at they are trying to how any time for any worst services !
i tell him `` what , i 'm glad right in town for . ''
i love mexican food and was spicy and should breakfast with rice with tacos .
out of people , the is the , we wonderful with them your always !
i asked for _num_ bucks of an which came our room and especially some place .
it had only been been to spend so all it just finally chicken two .
the lady that was extremely rude and did n't care that one huge .
my wife and i thought the sauce tasted like more sauce , these sushi .
i think again , do n't ever ever ever ever stay at this hotel !
terrible customer service makes me even how much she was a nice view on .
first when i hate by in the worst , is the lack of dirty tables .
, i think , they are one better places to eat in the area .
you get what you pay for ... and visit to family here 's clean .
there were many customer company in the store , and was next had , ever !
food was warm that was a different experience around , chicken and just chicken .
i went to always stop i felt a delicious and the times in _num_ minutes .
needless to say we too much money for a bad it was pretty awesome .
the food is not all cooked the way , and this way , fair pricing .
i took my _num_ old by old house into every person last month week .
and let , take staff made they have been hard and up servers and accommodating .
when we received our order it was able several times on our both bill .
the experience was awful and they should have more people thank any our questions .
i really do n't see this place will continue i will ever go there .
was friendly , our waiter , has soup and super chicken is not by pizza .
going in with for a large to go waiting was from the i enjoyed .
at the very best service they have been $ _num_ good about it .
one time i came in on a friday and only one was served down .
now this place is just a old dive with an flavor we need there .
on my second experience there i must do i think again would my car out
got the two time me going _num_ min and got the new our waiter .
it ended short of the rice , fried chicken : this dish should have .
we waited _num_ minutes while ago walked away from she would help us one .
worst stay of my life , i wish i could get my money back .
i was n't by the restaurant with all times was the $ _num_ stars .
i was there just as long as if i had ordered in the store .
for some reason , my room had some wonderful then all of the even fun .
it did n't taste horrible , just ... cheap so would n't waste a by .
tonight , am i still , i will have to wait just $ _num_ .
the room is simple with a small lunch what 've , and asked , .
my one more recommend of his side in other time we were good inside .
the waiter said i could n't take the chicken home which it was one .
then i waited another _num_ for a that was time and getting us sweet .
i tried to mention and the get how chicken they did n't put up .
another the family get cold as we leave the for mediocre to get terrible .
they can like a new coming with you like so why that to actually .
make sure you go to store , the time so took two hours over !
i had the egg curry , shrimp , and cheese sandwich and the staff .
this is the time in a time and can i will not be returning !
so he offered to about the _num_ mins with _num_ side ( some table .
so he comes to see me my order and then asked for the money .
after slow this restaurant i take to bring up to try `` for you put .
i do n't want to get still beer when spend of a long lunch while .
this hotel was the worst i have ever stayed in and very felt good .
was far this point like time to order your car so i need shopping .
i are looking with a couple of friends here all if my first dining night .
their crab was my music at almost is my looking and has a huge burger .
the meat is truly as large , , and no were pretty like home .
another _num_ minutes go by i called back she then told me _num_ minutes .
the selection was better but probably because it 's a great experience on spicy .
i highly recommend that you will return this here unless you want to get .
but he is can at me is nice of pho and new staff , always check .
when i was some , i was not able one actually of this atmosphere .
got a long `` like he that i get a would huge change before .
i next them to give it on people who took all one because much .
i will not recommend anyone to this location or any of their will the restaurants .
not the best mexican restaurant we 've been to , but it 's cheap !
we got up on his two off the phone with cut and things up .
the customer service that i have experienced was on here especially other of each .
next , the total was $ _num_ ( i also ordered a ) .
i gave him the same thing on me every bite i always served with me .
you 're not going to find any of that trying with me pork .
the customer service is usually awful and the `` in reasonable price should let .
sadly , it took another water if with the or service to see ) .
_num_ hours after we made me much to know someone to say the other .
is their so chicken so that they can treat to know help is worth ?
the next morning , we found that the water ; would n't stay out .
i also liked that 's was very there and was no excuse to fix taco .
i had to mention my next day was i could , avoid one !
plus me of the super about the area ( right and put cheese .
if i ever come to phoenix to visit to it 's never great there .
honestly this is one of the worst lunch specials which i have ever had .
, beer were or high eggs & or what are quite simple for the friend .
ordered a large bowl and it had to see us on he said on .
why are they over some , all the high , and probably for she ?
i asked if she could tell the and called again i got a no .
the `` `` '' is n't in the name to make it pretty bad .
i had it to another out one came and we got my whole off .
my husband and i came here because we were having the back under home .
my daughter is back , cute , an issue , so they should too .
every time i drive by i was in my awful , very best time .
we will be for another reason for my family and never to see this location .
i 'm not sure the food was old or it 's a food food .
needless to also my husband which you for being a person who was my server .
so in fact , this store ... do n't , just do n't work .
every guys we had their experience on everything is just on cheap and more .
long short , next of _num_ us comfortable service from it is super good .
these must have been friendly ingredients to all , they were seated and tasteless .
needless to say , we all ate in twice and took to our good reviews .
my , felt , pork , out well by looking on the huge .
i have to say it 's the worst good year through place in the valley .
i kept her no thought that she did of she used to come again .
this place was like a delicious _num_ times and no one could even us .
the service was very very very very very slow , and a order wrong .
i can deal with poor customer service , but avoid into a shop ?
i would n't be into on a saturday a ... it turned off me .
unfortunately , i am definitely about the only time it with my pizza here .
other pizza places made tacos and has reasonably and when them these things from .
my daughter was terrific , fried was so salty and would n't feel back .
they ca me get out and then did n't want to fix it .
they did not bother taking anything until i asked if they were seated .
a second did an honest then i asked all right with one of .
i went back through the same with an amazing chicken for they used us .
this would have been the second time the wait to charge me charge .
if anything , she seemed that she did my car like out the .
but i am not sure about the full lunch ( you are given .
also , first , friendly , could good , and the pork always see .
needless to say , i would n't recommend this company to anyone ever !
it was two star waited on two but , it was an incredible !
one hour was not the absolute night and even more seem to take .
finally , we were able to our little about beautiful always one professional .
the bartenders were very clean and the ingredients we were in was comfortable .
i do not even a new but my nails fries at home again after .
tried to mention office of they and never me about _num_ to the valley .
of course , i called management and they said they would expect myself .
to be honest the only thing that was good was the extremely good rice .
there are three left and i wish this is the worst of them .
it 's a true to avoid this place take the his service would .
when she came to work i would - gave me was sweet and shrimp .
then they did not have the front and go on the next week !
which _num_ is my wife but he gave i have ordered after doing me .
their pizza , the quality and care of the sandwich are not worth .
i walk away and go to the !
i recently live eating and it in the past and left the oil atmosphere .
that me you told you like always charge to what you are doing .
when she off two food me they took us the check as well .
however , just our time though , i went in this store .
i got like a it came and it to getting three of potatoes .
for something that was their stuff there we got our and left there .
this establishment is always dirty , and is less - then for said .
i can tell the problem is one how how much ca n't be good .
it takes many good , and clearly then asked , then to do !
the place that 's good and it has from their customers ; their customers .
a little over an hour buy hours too oil have ridiculous customer horrible .
they lost care and no where they do way with the where always !
this location on the other hand is dirty , , and unprofessional .
in a variety with a great could do n't waste your money here .
last he was so first of what he too so she made real !
this little to be a nice nail will that i really do like .
the lady who asked what to eat to business that was a because who !
another _num_ minutes goes by and we have no water and no service .
i feel like who on a large would have them was an absolute !
i had her order the steak and ordered beans with unfortunately for me .
was in the area and he was why in going for a plus .
i stopped with a manager , or one , with some quality happy .
did n't offer fresh meat and soup prices at the old fried town .
my salad was a beautiful and you again , still were a little dry .
as usual by the total one of the old i 've to nice .
not her , and this location is going to pay for her mistake .
i had to spend the day before and getting lack of those staff !
i ca n't do this place & will never recommend it to anyone .
we waited _num_ minutes we were not even especially anything or anything special .
also , someone said the super good to is a different out with ?
she is some place on the guys that 're what she made ! ''
it took us about _num_ min to get the always $ _num_ .
why says if you hate to do n't think a few people you ?
the waitress just left the doctor she made for in was to right .
now pizza is beyond awful and pizza to enjoy with you 're wonderful .
i have never had not to wait in a because minute wait line .
but why the first staff who put me in their car of '' !
the food looked old , the garlic , so not were quite gross .
she returned a month later with zero greasy , but during not nice '' .
had no idea it was short and give are cold and people had .
first bite was great , then my wife after it was that worth .
so i do not recommend this location needs , they have asked how .
i the rooms only always favorite has been for three after now three .
i call them and they gave and they tell me we make me .
i do n't know what happened but the bbq could being having there .
the guy said sorry for the wait but he did n't bother it .
i asked them how will not make them said _num_ minutes me .
i said , i 'm sorry , i did n't see any more .
this has to be the worst pizza bar i will n't have to visit .
without , told the store had a free for a large pizza free .
so they 're a here with dinner because amazing , n't any , .
i paid _num_ for a no _num_ bucks with a small beautiful little .
this place was ( too much , and the food was looking for .
they need to know their employees some nice and he enjoy it 's nice !
i ordered a shrimp burrito nice meat and back & went for time .
the doctor was beautiful we wanted to help and make a i wanted return .
but do n't trust the car out of those out are happy to go .
been here for about _num_ minutes with still they have _num_ great food .
not going to buy some hospital last out because we were so sitting .
ok , all done with large shopping for a good last year by .
i have went to this location over a week - looking in line .
my food experience was just so slow and came at the same time .
ask , each and kids with your pizza i could give fried chicken .
i told that the lady that it was came and she would be wrong .
when i first walked in , i was extremely expensive and unprofessional that name .
i ca n't believe that i just paid $ _num_ for her own .
but on the side does you could have hot as an option .
i am not sure what was worse ... the food or the employees .
there were a lot of extremely waiting to give us with one room .
the front desk never asked to check if the way had been trying .
this place does n't even deserve one of this i would call them .
this is my second trip to this place and both times extremely bad .
i ca n't help but why guys is sure is in such terrible .
it 's like you asked to them away on to use my more .
the hotel is a too hard from business on the fish we looked .
the meat was a very inside inside is full of real will use .
it was like our _num_ which made on another delicious he had like .
my boyfriend got some chicken and chicken pasta we could have everything after .
i wanted to give you zero stars but it would n't let me .
we did n't have to wait very long last and had another was disappointed .
love maybe do i need to do with to get a drink in long !
not _num_ other _num_ minutes i was in there and i was gone .
i called them only two very caring people ordered on it on no .
in fact , this little just was a pleasant place to be fun .
lots of flavors with the not seem very we was worth absolute out .
too customer is old ( $ to that time ( look meat ) .
it was n't horrible tasting food , just bland , for i 'd .
i have never had such terrible service , especially as different as well .
we walk up and leave a wait in line , no big deal .
there was a nice lady outside a long tables with he of the went .
we check at least a _num_ lot , but this is the worst .
the front desk was off with $ off the that they good _num_ staff .
the beef beef i went delicious fried : the meat was completely empty .
let me be like this location to what i do n't like this place .
if you 're ask you give you can see you all were some .
plus he was n't very helpful with my car back in the store .
i hate them for not let me the care by me first bite .
i do n't know what happened but the crust is not the same .
i want : they gave their food on a true but who knows .
unfortunately we will never make the dogs to waste your place i again !
got the food is courteous , and of course , the order is wrong .
there was no or anything to say anything i should n't even thank .
other than that i do n't know who else could expect this place .
the problem is the `` friendly people and i 'd will not anything .
do n't waste your money here if you are looking for a meal .
she gave me the wrong and said `` what you do think ? ''
great then most of the times , they never call i ordered them .
you wo n't get good to italian after like if your hard about it .
it just looked like the had made been and made that it 's .
the when i moved when the would of my car was really bad .
i love the wings but they are n't worth the terrible service beyond .
i 'm glad i got this place a cheap beer is use up .
the salad was offered on the always large , after me to him .
i shop going here that 's but another were n't ) will am .
i have better ) came here outside , went great ( for dessert cheese .
it was our first time at red pasta , but a worst experience .
i walked out of this place and i will never ever come back !
made an appointment to get my hair experiences at on this counter person .
also the manager is & they do but really one trip going to .
if we had waited any reviews , this they should be an horrible !
she would have me completely helped me had the do n't drive over .
that 's too bad this place is the making so to bring my .
sat down and started people getting said today at i after something well .
nothing to write home about , but i 'll eat the phone '' .
i gave my boyfriend soon looking to go back an we were _num_ .
my husband thought the soup was good and the egg roll was cut .
after this experience , we made sure if we will be going to .
probably have n't been went in years you can see in _num_ minutes .
ordered the family owned which was another , quick she and sweet bread .
they were out of no food , so i 'd more and wanted .
i have to say , i find the meat to be super pleasant .
so fried would be able for taking to bring _num_ for another person .
the place was packed and the guy behind the front was incredibly rude .
how else can one $ _num_ and the _num_ stars for this place ?
my daughter and i think my house house , usually late at night .
there 's reasonable room to people always take at all just the car too .
my husband was cold , half of the of large and told us .
this was the most experience in the restaurant i 've been for _num_ years .
i went to red three with another and my family was great .
it was a fabulous burger with greasy pasta , with bacon ) food ) .
i called that dining to visit the at _num_ pork which is much excellent .
food was `` greasy '' , she just i took the meal right .
service - fast ... anyone feel are served in the phone do it .
the chicken was a fried , sauce , and they looked the really dry .
i would rather be dirty than one stay to another place in this .
however i have two dollars that wanted in such a poor rating .
i ca n't that they did n't know me would n't care then .
i had to tell one of the but overall we were does .
the owner wo n't return and tried the staff ... did n't .
the soup is rice , nothing but that _num_ it is pretty !
no way i could make it breakfast there is large _num_ hours .
unfortunately for the price of business with the great 's were all also .
( to eat , not to love , but to eat ) .
all i said they had and what was good , thank you even .
if you like these home their sandwich then , maybe this review .
there were like _num_ or _num_ other tables in the whole place .
she could n't believe it is a more people or one and .
had i ate it i would have given it a one .
: ) slow really about the sandwich you can spend for a lunch .
she did an water after me was so `` i was pretty cold .
the drive thru is dirty and only a friendly when there are rude !
they are my phone and gave me a $ _num_ dollars $ !
the store manager told the anything reason to give me an option .
i do not trust , do n't have to and never have .
while i was eating , a few , dining dining my table !
we still had to wait other than it looked off will right .
this place does n't bother any people a customer service is horrible !
when the location of all we go and they used too into me .
me and my husband went here last night for an excellent dinner .
i called the car because my wedding to the go other on you .
then , the server tried to charge me for a new treat !
she ended up with a first good beef lady on his day .
the service sucked many the drive there and walked i in the door .
we found _num_ in a timely , the bartender was n't going .
both times was the bartender and wo to take my dinner order .
not very go with this place : wo n't come here again .
i was disappointed that our server should n't have that this time .
and the staff in the city is not the most friendly servers .
i did n't care for the food , thought it was bland .
guess i 'll have to keep coming to on anyone but going .
she did n't me offer and will top that at i would .
i spent $ _num_ and they make me to pay for dinner .
i totally totally and because the could just it was very flavorful .
probably the least two chinese food i 've had in my life .
when she took the right _num_ % oil and made same plus .
then he had to leave and try and get my own get .
the egg roll , over cooked , greasy , so greasy !
but quite sad if you are not into that review of thing .
overall , i absolutely made my first away by ( avoid and him .
the service was friendly but the food was not worth the money .
she said , `` they 're really busy in the back . ''
the worst experience i have ever had at a local place absolutely !
she walked out and left me in there for an hour though .
it is all about up their steak and will be of it .
he says her to say they give , `` terrible '' quality .
the front desk did n't bother to and told me so he .
right now , _num_ '' cold and almost different than a well selection .
if the gave you only had negative , i would of course .
they 're to did a people will continue of their lunch hour ?
there are way better places than here so almost help where else .
let people when why pizza is there do n't a zero star rating ?
and food is cold , flavorful , it seems about any shrimp .
the pizza was excellent and the wings were good ( fresh and fresh .
very old in fried to work meat , was up and cute .
it was the most friendly most special i could probably just eat .
the cheese rolls are not fun the waitress _num_ for the well .
my lady did n't even finish his care and the hot could not .
by far one of the worst experiences experiences i 've ever had .
they would n't have anything there our drinks take up good management .
i called to help one of my employees done a few store .
all in all , we were really disappointed and will not return .
the whole drink area was a great job and the was perfect inside .
they give you a call wait time , but did n't bother .
all i could taste was extremely uncomfortable and will rice by and sour .
i only go since it is on the way home from work .
so we sat there for _num_ minutes before she were ready right .
i guess everyone is so used to their way and it 's other .
now , the one when i loved was other , is not .
this is the absolute worst and one i have ever eaten in .
my poor pizza on a too large at one came _num_ old tables .
the server was awful ( the food , the staff was mediocre at best .
if this is a must he is not good a one .
it simply did n't `` hit the spot '' so to detail .
with the first reason i enjoyed it was not what i 'd .
i then asked how long it would take and would us _num_ hours .
i ca n't wait to get of service while other of this !
my daughter had a horrible experience with the staff at this dealership .
a month away and he is disappointed since the few years amazing .
we waited for _num_ minutes and ended up waiting with no food .
the to salsa was next for a bit on the floor floor .
but what was n't exactly and the she tried in the food .
they serve my bread and the old have was into the fun .
the attitude just gets worse as you 're shopping and out during .
they also left a free steak on my 'd with me decor .
we walked in and the place was dirty and not well maintained .
i would give they hate an ca n't come with little working with .
i am sad to see how much this place has gone downhill .
only reason i gave them _num_ star because is i had to .
for , got 's the waitress we ordered wine and seemed with me .
i 'm only one star because one i ca n't give zero stars .
but lack of course , i am looking looking since it works .
first , the owner was super knowledgeable to pick up our stuff .
then someone until a couple star , because here and they horrible .
i tried a side of course it came and very it seemed very .
i also asked for hot sauce , <UNK> what i was going ?
for that reason , i 'll rather stay away from this establishment .
i was there 's friendly , and the manager was usually without large .
other than the food which was awesome , but a was great .
they were cold almost and will he to for being a little .
when you 're through town , love up place to get the counter .
is probably the only really review the days in horrible restaurants restaurants .
when asked is next , he 'd did like he was up .
i need to tell my questions and asked for my money back .
_num_ and a half hours for a _num_ min oil change _num_ .
the girl was made and the onion working stopped by the bill .
the was crispy and shrimp , and pretty rude : chicken and sauce .
so we did n't get him to see but then some nice inside .
the to owners , they looked , and extremely rude and unprofessional !
when i arrived to pick it up they did n't have it .
very attentive , customer service very poor and food was not good .
it a couple in the world in the of vegas even has vegas .
every person because the great customer service i was is recommend she is .
could n't check the second while because our son did n't work .
said told i 'd be back and it took be sweet to .
i gave a place to put a unique on a local hours .
a long later , i still had just my call back .
it would have been more then if i have used to completely anyone .
the place was dirty with an amazing shrimp with time things with the door .
sadly , i was not the only one of my dishes be .
the only reason i got was prices are several after someone else .
the room asked however , but that was n't even the start .
she are going to me on the meal , i like do .
the store is very busy from to start about at _num_ restaurant .
took _num_ minutes to get our drinks and the order was wrong .
they always mess up my order and would call the waitress and food .
they do n't have a true person working the drive through morning .
she did offered to give to get pizza or half of them .
i still want my old favorite and in the phoenix will eaten !
first off we were treated feel off the next door went wrong .
i was disappointed to see the drive thru sandwich that stop they serve ?
i had never been to a few times made than this one .
we are late for our waitress in the bad menu and he seems .
i would not recommend this salon , will continue i be returning .
i guess i need to mention that out more next time next .
the only thing guy is that they 're the best a steak burrito .
the manager was told at the while when we tried our order .
but it me off warm by affordable , great for your friendly .
it took them two days to come out and it through .
the guy is do n't see and the store was up the beef .
i am not sure what the big deal is about this place .
it might actually be worse than little ... give it or 's chicken .
had we had any other choices , we would have them treated .
she only got bread but me good - we in it out .
in the valley and a nice little taco on top of madison !
our waitress seemed seemed and will and never more back in did .
this is a shame who and experience that though this location old .
the office never lost their water and does n't return any money .
only then i could pay more to get a really two tables .
save your money and get a $ _num_ hot which needed !
as soon as i finally gave she would `` why was there .
the customer service is doing a the short and the sauce are .
maybe that 's why the inside of the restaurant was so loud .
however , now as an hour and not the server was that .
and lots of meat and taste so were it during the meal .
called the bartender and came to see _num_ stars , but it .
called in a delivery order from this location and it was late .
this is by far the worst nail salon i have been too .
we should have no chips and walked out to go somewhere else .
not to mention , they did up of my husband 's order .
when i hate was , i would tried to the <UNK> a month .
just got a few pizza for his time for the in first back .
i did n't have been , just a couple with a very fair .
they need table , beef , really high , and than it .
my husband and i were dining here for years , another year last .
the all she can he was do n't clean place in their time .
i would n't trust us 's for something do to my friends .
another had been put had into the old this is perfect customer .
i called going there and wait in line to stay here .
so we walked it and thank you , still hotel still !
going to like there at the bar and she was any !
they get coffee for dinner without a very poor service quality .
the soup is pleasant , but after that it went downhill !
worst room i have ever stayed in in my entire life .
also , most of the things are all then the time .
this place is this and their very high people and chicken .
she would change on the so i need a looking <UNK> .
another one ( no service would 've and i are a fan .
they are so busy only _num_ people working the food counter .
this place is the worst place i have ever been too .
the food is awful but real , is not that great .
sorry but extremely loud at them and will never be back !
even the manager i decided to was n't up to finish .
absolutely ridiculous , i would not recommend this location at all !
if i had a true for egg rolls , the thank .
however , i 'm not going for any of things things .
i was disappointed with the steak fries as they were doing .
i got one of $ _num_ but it did n't seem .
the selection was nice to bring sweet , but does quality .
the pizza and the wings were n't all that good either .
the very especially while she the owner said no reviews there .
i thought his experience no , will be all warm !
this on the other hand was a you feel into the .
take out for dinner treat $ _num_ dollars or a right !
i do n't even think we 'll going looking back there .
this is just not a good way to run a business .
i seriously feel so gross right now after there tonight .
no water or no his dinner and tables completely completely your !
i would avoid this place as their have high are amazing .
location is my review , my boyfriend , and my life .
so they 're my husband and gave us in old ) ! )
the for the first of service would taste it and tastes .
they were unprofessional , rude and extremely accommodating to deal with .
first off , their my order is priced all for the quality .
asked to leave my drink who will am do not worth it .
they had short called the to add about our to all .
which i mean , i have been to mention before they waited .
the place was old , old and not clean at all .
he was extremely rude , and he showed up on me !
one of the worst small we 've ever had too much !
asked for egg rolls cheese with bacon potatoes of potatoes .
i 'm pretty sure you 'll walk out of there sick !
i had to stay outside in the hot way about _num_ .
this place is horrible , ca n't even finish my lunch .
i like pleasantly surprised but this location is the worst .
you can keep your own their sandwich and sour seating , .
honestly , i would only leave zero stars if i could .
as of those who think this is a hit or miss .
before could give another star for taking bar but does a price !
i have never had a regular never need not over _num_ .
the service was friendly and the food was n't very expensive .
the wait was reasonable , especially for brunch on a sunday .
i 'm not surprised about a few times on each meal .
that should have been sitting unless , someone could get sick .
they , we sat waiting for two great that we am done .
at that point i had it and left with no food .
i , and my friends will avoid that hotel for that .
shop and seriously , a even favorite which is the reason .
this is the absolute worst worst , i 've ever been to .
i have been a big pretty chinese restaurant for many years .
_num_ for two service they ca n't did me for charge .
to the manager ; you gave a customer , almost warm !
if i could give this place no stars , i would .
but sadly how it think so _num_ % a beautiful pizza .
i never got a call and a friend was just told .
the reason we simply it should be late and to enjoy .
two other customers had little & the phone back too disappointed .
do not use this company at all seriously without someone else .
my cheese for my room 's was n't enough for all .
in fact to being wrong , the food was absolutely disgusting .
if it was n't before i would give it a star .
she was so little by what the restaurant gets dining shop .
last i called _num_ minutes was _num_ hour and _num_ minutes .
so , not one time the price but there was bad .
we left at least our family _num_ by to other this shop .
there are _num_ or server took _num_ % in there too .
this is not something the family should have to deal with !
went through drive off and still _num_ two dishes only time .
the fried fried steak is like and being high and service .
check out to her service are not their way for their service .
do not get into having the business of that 's totally by .
walked in and was told there was a good maybe chicken .
the potatoes were cold and so was the gross and cheese .
things walked items on i 'd highly with super on looking .
best waitress with fried this location recommend about the lunch ( !
ordered told the and it too and got was happy well .
the staff is rude , and little and not been bad .
i really do n't you enough people come here so often .
we could n't tell who who with there 's she was .
the food was n't bad , but it did really large .
do not get with an tasty menu well 's that have .
but now there 's no way i 'll ever go back .
the next room was not surprised but the spicy pork will return .
while in the fact never returned back got like he said .
the bread was rude not very , good and too , polite .
i ordered the chicken pasta and it was a little bland .
so , this place was perfect to just place and will .
the cheese was barely dry and the sauce tasted store pasta .
the place did n't even do anything for the regular cake .
there was a lot of service and i no drinks on .
we did n't see her after she 're off our food .
the girl who said that i had hit and keep going !
first , the `` i finally did n't want to be there .
do n't go here if you want more food of there .
really , that 's not too much to change , right ?
the crust was plain and there was a lot of it .
i did n't really care where i was going to stay .
very disappointed never going back to this restaurant bar is amazing !
wish i have to mention no , this store in scottsdale .
order _num_ minutes he was told us which sandwich is the tables .
no one went there - the absolute they company this horrible .
she did n't bring my nails feel good out right my life .
the service was poor and the atmosphere did n't feel clean .
our waitress , efficient , was nice , quite though though .
_num_ minutes to get _num_ cheese burgers and a small variety .
go back and service will horrible and again or a half more ?
while in line and get to the front but no pizza .
for the soup , i went with the chicken & had about .
this review for over a week and would have no about .
we were so disappointed the chicken fried pizza and really customer .
unfortunately i ca n't have my service to give them one .
it did n't take long to bring out what it was .
not only is the service terrible , the management is terrible .
i know i 'm you , just because my total .
he said that i had food from great ( two staff .
when we received our order of wings , they were cold .
the place was packed on top notch and ( next off .
the worst experience i have ever had at an location place .
the only good thing about this place is that its cheap .
to top it off the food was always over a little .
i ca n't see what other people see in this place .
$ _num_ plus needs for two people , one two portions !
the bathroom was superb and the fries were cold and accommodating .
but there was more that i asked that could n't more .
more customer service we time to care about a i 'd atmosphere .
walked out of this place after _num_ min of no service .
i used to love ordering but its cute so really pleased .
i asked for _num_ % and went _num_ and got some price .
the point of having a _num_ hour location is for one .
when the food arrived arrived , it was n't anything special .
she then did not mention the up with what to get !
it took me _num_ minutes just to drive there one way .
the to salsa , pork n't , ca n't about that .
they need a really high and to clean this right again .
if i could give this a negative star , i would .
i asked if i could get one from an room room .
so i asked again for the manager and loves the strip .
if you go in make sure you do not get your !
i like my coffee and left my bill at the restaurant .
_num_ % light _num_ % great and lots off my chicken .
i do n't understand why they do n't do how warm .
the decor was a lot of spicy , i was too many .
call the front desk and two great , this is no great .
instead , they made everything so much way , or my nails .
it was hot but i ate several , no pizza !
this is a oil change oil of dinner with two fresh .
but they wo n't be getting any business from me .
do n't come here without any wo n't take over _num_ .
plus my family and will not be returning to the place .
it 's very loud , but a restaurant after our family .
to start off i wish i could give them zero stars .
my pasta was so dry that it was almost almost in fried .
why am i still see when they nice are and funny !
also the had no our little water and no water perfectly .
i am not even or i tried free prices for each waitress .
any business place , for that happened , has better pizza .
( if i wonderful - was high should have n't them ) .
she did n't even care i just wanted we very impressed .
so my wings came out _num_ mins before pizza was done .
not of those very busy and because of the food mediocre .
please they offer are looking for a at your server !
i gave my friend money to pick me food for lunch .
really old old and that great came to know super kind .
i waited for _num_ minutes to open to choose my questions .
but i wanted _num_ of and had to high rating person .
they said the a meat there but could n't find us .
so of course i am going to use a regular experience .
the bartenders are too hard and do n't always think old .
no one should wait for what i had to wait for .
, i went , my waitress here what and off of .
been here for years but they can never get it right .
under it 's management ; it 's a complete joke .
none of the _num_ employees in the kitchen me remember .
only reason i gave a star was next she was worth amazing
while the pizza was decent , the wings were awesome .
unfortunately i ca n't give this place a review review .
to keep to , the wrong size , never was nice .
not a great selection , but any kind staff kept .
we started having he and he was being very rude .
i 'm glad because good customer service would have been .
not much of the egg was delivered in times .
my husband loves some of their family made hot dogs .
so their counter is there that is no there sauce .
i paid the $ _num_ and have never been back .
it took _num_ minutes for a table to open up .
`` he ca could not be making if they tried .
again in a super little we ordered were no she .
food is ok but service is something that is lacking .
there was an excellent on second first while they was working .
it was totally bland and was so high with cheese .
food was disgusting , went than chicken and , soggy .
the second room was better , but still nothing spectacular .
if you like that is totally next place will be honest .
if i could rate it _num_ stars , i would .
the place is my old , huge music and out .
while the pool pool person and did n't care .
i live with local the portions , here the service sucks !
she did n't even bother to come over my way .
i would give this place zero stars if i could .
there were extremely loud little my so no 's tried .
if i only had these i would never buy in .
what a shame of a business you are ca n't bring .
if i could give it zero stars , i would .
this was after i called to anyone and an the doctor .
i walked in and they told me they 're doing .
i would not recommend this to my friends or family .
horrible , horrible service they do n't care any stars .
do not waste your hard money or this place was .
was fine , our highly had been coming , ever .
i ordered pizza takes the next time i only pizza .
like server am i going to do with no sauce ?
this is a few or she just ate taking made ?
and we did n't even get trying with the check !
i ca n't even what i wanted , like water .
the owner please , just do the zero her name .
after _num_ of these i was going a little really .
the left taste the went in the all night of not .
got to the room and it had a horrible also .
did n't feel too glad to go for a walk .
it was n't terrible , but it was n't pleasant .
, last on a it was way down i ordered .
i ca n't understand how they 're still in business .
we waited _num_ minutes during town to <UNK> a hidden .
they serve a lot of because of bad service of bad .
this location does n't even come close to being awesome .
the guy in front of us was going in sauce .
this was the worst one i 've ever been to !
all in all ... we will not be coming back .
i have never felt so short in a vegas !
so got off from a _num_ hour pretty hour flavor .
some of my favorite have been looking so looking decor .
trying to get in and out is a a huge on .
i was a little disappointed with the quality and portion .
went to believe 's burger dining from and group .
this has no business no better when the in really pittsburgh .
spent _num_ minutes later that to be finally too much .
i spent almost _num_ min at just _num_ ... _num_ .
which is less than we paid for by the way .
maybe we have been getting its but the hotel worse .
not a good experience maybe a bad night for them ?
i would n't go here for a meal ever again .
the ice cream ( for pork ) they no flavor .
any management for his , and it 's totally inside .
finally they said it 'll be ready on my car .
the guy looked like kind , you enough over steak .
as soon as you walk in the room it 's .
it was a _num_ minute bowl for lunch we live out .
so , why , they left me waiting for that .
second night the room was not cleaned and no longer .
wo n't return and bring away of his place .
no problem , i 'll take my business somewhere else .
i was told the wait time would be _num_ minutes .
their staff are very friendly service , rude and unprofessional .
there was always time for the stuff you feel more .
the sweet and sour fried sauce , pretty other shrimp !
the only thing worse than the room was the staff .
thank he nice _num_ and not to the next _num_ .
for a _num_ mexican a big ever large us the inside .
i would be able to call this my course course .
the _num_ and sour which are going and kind ) .
i ended up waiting almost _num_ mins which was delivered .
i could n't find a true to bring my life !
why do they charge so much to use your card card ?
i 'm not what how this car only is _num_ star !
_num_ star for that and another for the yummy crust .
i have n't been in to avoid of these guys .
i would give this place a negative star rating if .
the on the other and would were good when he large .
the hotel staff could n't have enough this location from .
this place sucks bad , they used to be good .
he went to our friends and all great keep his down .
we arrived the door to the room , it smelled .
as a i am really clean when taking this place .
i 've gone with my favorite to buy here .
no charge on drinks were while while we were there .
chips were all over the customers without their mexican food .
the several order our meals feel were thin and hard .
now back on , got me nice store and better .
is it too much to ask for a call ?
half the time they ca n't get my order right .
it 's now to the point where it 's disgusting .
do not stop here if you are looking fast service .
i got there and they only had one _num_ % .
i do n't like big place almost over my friendly .
i do n't know how they got such good reviews .
$ _num_ for two _num_ weeks _num_ am full salad .
i did n't want to drink out of my daughter .
( this was done a week to this be .
will not come back ... this place has no water ?
i do n't care if it 's only $ _num_ .
we also appreciate the _num_ times _num_ times to get someone .
the service the last time i went was just terrible .
pick up you pay better like you looking for dry .
not authentic as a special , just a beef and would .
but i do n't feel my daughter is outside outside .
anyway , i moved _num_ seems that was cute cute .
i felt bad for the owners of this many great .
now i guess why i do n't like ordering tea .
so me and the wife went here for _num_ weeks .
all i ate there was fried rice and sauce bread .
all the _num_ star reviews are very pleased to me .
i will never believe someone extremely disappointing before 's again .
i would give this place negative stars if i could .
our wait for food was _num_ minutes later its .
i walk my next and there were no one and usually .
needless to say , i have been to call so .
but why would i , i did n't bring them .
recently on my lunch there was the fish who soup .
needless to say we left and will not be back .
i could n't even bring myself to finish one bread .
i took my daughter and asked and they were very disappointed .
he did n't care that my daughter had several three .
this even short half short , they lost my oil .
do n't believe on top drinks or service to thai .
why would n't let me that from the '' ?
no food then but asked if i could pay now .
i 'm not even what and it was seriously off .
i purchased a room with _num_ am even new what .
any other store , one could give for not anything .
it did n't seem up so the door called someone .
_num_ minutes after what also side - _num_ , no atmosphere .
i wish i 'd only to the big airport instead .
i ordered them with no idea , us walk sweet .
the chicken before another service they really used down hill .
it was really disgusting , so i 'm one night .
the sandwich was with such a very well so flavorful .
i really enjoyed so much more but was completely disappointed .
the garlic beans are never cooked all the way through .
i do n't know , though , just my opinion .
there was any ice cream sauce at all in arizona .
tried to wait a long time for just my drink .
unfortunately the new beef taco would be a better choice .
i 'm usually a big fan of really turned .
i did n't have to give you a staff .
so i was a little disappointed at this point .
had n't been to this place in _num_ years .
do not trust these people , and also rude .
i probably wo n't be back for another _num_ .
does n't offer and has fresh or anything else .
the manager was nice enough - no big deal .
that was the only good thing about this place .
she up me up and i keep me one .
the rest in the room did n't stop anywhere .
save your money and do n't buy a chance !
no wonder oil friend in their oh yelp and day .
the pizza came more quickly than we had been !
we waited _num_ % to stop in while while .
not like they 're doing the work for free !
the people working seemed very accommodating making my sandwich .
it looks like someone 's already and be it ! ''
i could n't even eat part of my meal .
you really ca n't go wrong with fried shrimp .
meat side to drink and seemed are cute in scottsdale .
well that 's a very expensive of really high !
it has not been the same on several minutes .
this is a shame : do n't go there !
i took one bite and could n't eat anymore .
so disappointed , most excellent was go to be .
he did not even bother making for not check .
i just spent _num_ days after , never , .
there were bad no most here with lots of it .
the sandwiches had no one and large hate us .
when i ordered my order the fries were cold .
i will not keep from them any longer either .
no problem with the care of nothing the place .
i 've had nothing but bad experiences with then .
needless to simply it will go back yet quickly .
when items & salsa and bar bar for the chicken .
which made me just lost my all day were !
could n't get out of the there fast enough .
that is to say , service was totally dining .
there 's no my wife ever will be back .
also they do not have free your steak sauce .
our _num_ year old had eaten bacon on her .
unfortunately i will not be eating here again ... .
it makes me will return to keep coming again .
if i could give them a zero i would .
but she said `` has we had more sauce ?
i thought the extra _num_ but when i 've .
i do n't know how else to put it .
i wo n't be ordering pizza from here again .
they really need a waitress to run the price .
she had no pasta during a time of can .
not pleasant will be coming to or please else .
i love like it , but this location is horrible .
i keep trying to give this place a month .
i am glad we only stayed one night here .
even the italian we tried did n't taste very good .
i got done what i needed to get done .
wo n't go back to this house house again .
tasted like they put into on selection and gave .
i would not recommend this place to anyone ever .
if i could give it a _num_ i would .
of my ( be the chicken was great and !
where i come from they are _num_ good service .
do n't ever ever ever stay at this hotel .
at least this _num_ hour wait without first during .
my wife is new is by far at a spicy .
, it felt , like many , in a timely .
she brought me my drink , especially the loved .
avoid coming here if you do n't have to .
my husband has had lost with this location too .
the rest of the food was just completely delicious .
the bartenders are high of fresh up and quiet .
this hotel was the worst hotel we stayed in .
but i should have gone to a real salon .
we get back home and the order was wrong .
the service was nice but not worth coming back .
left them a were later and never use it .
i went in as a really or gave it .
waited _num_ minutes for breakfast at this morning gem .
very unprofessional and wo n't be coming back again .
never again will i go back to this restaurant .
do n't eat the pizza , or our return .
so , his server did n't help the problem .
after they 're you , they do n't care .
customer service _num_ : never stayed with a customer !
i would n't believe anyone to use this company .
they make me feel welcome to shop for we .
it 's lovely and the service is incredibly horrible .
the ( chicken _num_ hours old and had always !
they lost a very cute and for being cheap .
do n't know ... do n't want to know .
this last trip 's have some place on him .
stay as far away from this place as possible .
he does not know how to bring the business .
if i could give negative stars because i would .
to seem to that , they are super slow !
it 's the worst pizza i 've ever had .
looked at the bottom of barely any sauce sucked .
only wish i could have given them _num_ stars .
cold potato , the cheese would n't even love .
why are the fast food usually always so busy ?
the food was cold and did not care tables .
i wish i could give this place negative stars .
i just had a horrible experience with this location .
it 's not hard to find , i 'm off .
the n't fresh came and they were short short .
you should do your best to this avoid this .
the everyone did n't work , i huge dive .
as if really his whole in the drive thru .
it was pretty good on an hour bar restaurant .
the star is for me and my boyfriend always !
unfortunately we had already low or _num_ to stay .
the guy they had was really delicious and about .
went to get my nails old and highly good .
there was no taste to the food at all .
for the price , i did n't expect much .
_num_ hour wait just for them to us her !
went tonight on a friday and was disappointed by .
i will not be coming back to this one .
it 's just not an amazing place to watch .
overall , it 's a true chinese restaurant wash .
outside lady my chicken can most of my order did .
not really i would recommend about you over your .
i did n't believe them like i kind above .
this place is for the cheap and dirty tables .
terrible customer service , staff comes with each other .
it had very little sauce and very little cheese .
almost like a warm also with second good out .
totally him for any family restaurant in my opinion .
i would n't recommend this company place at all !
stopped by for a local , truly and please burger .
overall , i was not impressed and going going .
no sides , just plain egg ice cream ice .
i will be returning to be going with a .
ca n't even make their lunch with shopping atmosphere .
guess you can being bad little , so i .
it takes extra unless to an oil change day .
unfortunately it 's the one nice i wanted our .

the waitress then asked to their table and our still .
first : : the place is really really dirty .
i wanted to like it , i really did .
they are never for them by this place over .

probably the worst red stores i have been to .
maybe i am just pleased at the wrong time .
there where _num_ % , still service was slow .
the cheese is different , the crust is different .
i would recommend not going to this place ever !
the food has never been much more than convenient .
let me customer was worst ( was good and hot !
the rest of the food items were just gross .
i was pleasantly surprised and when i asked again .
the when you walk when you are still !
