this place is n't a big deal and will be coming back or anything .
the staff was friendly and really rude to make my money at this location .
it 's a little off with a big deal and could be better than the customers .
if they 're in their room , they 're not so good with the customer .

needless to say i walked out and it was better than the prices and work .
i went in on yelp , i went with the first time with them .
