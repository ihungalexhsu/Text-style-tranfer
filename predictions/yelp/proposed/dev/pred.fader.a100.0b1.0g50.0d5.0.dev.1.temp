by far the worst dining experience i 've ever had the best company ever .
i was so excited to find a place to give how for so good .
very and easy that 's really good better or spicy food on them to .
to make things than the place , the best has a nice of the wait .
i live up a few minutes later and overall its a different be reviews being .
when you pay for your order her to while being for us your order .
called this morning and took to see a better to review more of oil a drink .
keep it is a new and like the beer and `` , it 's that .
i used to love the owner , but cute this and they were outstanding .
after he had just been when she used in town for over _num_ minutes .
my husband and i went to and we went through when the next door .
very well if she do who do we think from everything she can eat there .
it was easy to shop because i have nothing ... many in the people .
even when i can love about food to give out friendly you of the work .
long time customer who is now amazing on what good for in go to happy .
i asked for a to go for a whole over a year and shrimp working .
i 've stayed at many times about _num_ minutes and it was n't like .
he was helpful at first than but even top who when we were n't working .
i will never be back to have old home and ca n't give its money .
i was told that i would have to wait over a week for the dining .
she was not a fan of the my we finally was made with the rice .
my boyfriend pasta & burger was , i do n't know a better job .
i took my wife and 'd went a friend with only for making super .
this place did not and i was able to finish my $ _num_ star .
i 've had better from other places ; warm and nail from restaurants in .
we ca n't say nothing too long time until my waitress to table .
only recommend for its the owner , `` everyone is just the time you .
no course , no going to customers people of , no ) for the its .
this place does n't is first than the first place _num_ on sunday end .
here , this dish is , but on yelp , had no one to start .
i wait anyone from them one on yelp ... then more especially i ask you .
some new and do most , any customer i 've made a happy hour thing !
no one should have to wait _num_ hours _num_ hours , my actually to clean .
i recently went in to a table i 've found twice in phoenix worth zero .
be on the phone , i cut almost up , when them anything about it .
if you do n't ... well be , right your car to be order .
i guess if you do n't know going here but i call a more expensive .
they do n't bring my nails ( _num_ months ( only to _num_ up .
waitress if i say from it 's like my call , i love up .
they had some hard working employees but also kids this can customer i see .
a must have a small shop with `` of the sweet are some of chicken .
i had _num_ minutes to make it to the new location before the entire fries .
a little more and only for sure everyone than this restaurant is your and best .
some of the are truly , yet ; going to the one with awesome .
it 's not to mention everyone to everyone us one for my nails business .
never was even from the sandwich and probably his family things about _num_ quality .
after _num_ minutes my pizza was done now but the waitress and horrible were .
honestly i come to this gem i 'll think i 'd this one i .
the lady that did my name did not even put a few of she .
she was rude beyond , even know by more different on the dishes .
the bread was incredibly , yummy , and ) , without all into the business .
which is also a place i would not want to ever go back to .
we stopped by the next day ago -- to stop up two years soon .
by the time our food got to the table , our drinks were empty .
overall would never visit that 's experience and would n't recommend i want to find .
i 'm disappointed to say i 'll be returning this one for now on .
the crust on a great sandwich was better than the spot on this is the area .
same hotel , never amazing ... ... especially every night ... with price customer service .
i could go on and on no but i 'll definitely get the $ _num_ .
not be than service and know you have to same busy time any things ?
i tell him `` say , i 'm doing in home for life restaurant .
i love mexican food and was plenty of bbq home and with chicken burrito .
come on people , the is the point and this little restaurant to your spot !
i asked for them a $ time half salad but no other of wine .
it had only been been coming for the first experience so still consistently new .
the lady that was extremely rude and did n't care the hotel can be seated .
my wife and i 've was super right & more like chicken at fish menu .
i would say , do n't ever ever ever ever stay in what ever not !
terrible customer service : me even tell how much to the manager 's a smile .
first day i shop when i think the place is the most of steak .
plus , i think i have gone will be coming to eat in the area .
you get what you pay , go here - try to visit in family .
there were many customer service in the area , and have was open _num_ !
food was warm , we was n't take to work chicken and cold drinks were .
i went to 's anyone of it before and the food came in go .
needless to say we finally too much money for not a very good job .
the food is not cooked all the way , and , top to buy area .
i took my _num_ order off getting into after making only return last years .
and his with old also can have been very new music and more know .
when we received our order it was trying up staff out i enjoyed us .
the experience was awful and they should have more people items make i eat long .
i really do n't believe this place best since i ever never eat there .
the restaurant was very fun , he made and has a free and did n't .
going in with for the menu for lunch to got the stars on the .
at the very best it should have been _num_ min for me very worth .
one time i came in on a saturday and only one thing is flavorful .
now this place is just a fan place but over to take very special .
on my last experience i would of not i have since i would give my i would recommend it them
got _num_ hours the more wrong off us the waitress she had our close .
it takes short of the fried , fried chicken crust this dish should have .
we waited _num_ minutes before their car table and walked us from still less .
worst customer visit on the time just i liked i get my money back .
i was excited for the cheese to work the same was $ _num_ more .
i was there just as long as i went there in the store in .
for some people was looking a quick had different some delicious , all the place .
it did n't taste a staff , customer ... its never a local place .
probably , took it said i 'm worst i have to wait its _num_ min .
the room is simple , pretty great for almost the restaurant , and reasonably .
my one take of his cheese coffee to buy done at it was good .
the waiter said i could n't take the shrimp home because it was doing .
then i waited another _num_ for a week that was on busy though and cheese .
i tried to say and the great even ( did n't like he _num_ is .
called my wings at most of right at the area and to get a wonderful .
they really need to get some to their steak that there know , you need .
make sure you have time to , my wife , made us more and hot !
i had the egg rolls , yes , and cheese sandwich and the and welcoming .
this is the time i found at visit , it will not be returning !
so he came to the old i would looking to cut without almost on wine .
so he 's happy to my husband _num_ and his job for me and money .
sorry the service reviews and i 'd tried to call up by this needs .
i do n't want to give many soon minutes of my lunch hour through .
this hotel was the worst i ever have ever stayed and and still the taste .
, when i ca n't even want from order to eat years is fair authentic .
i 'm looking with a lot of friends this morning place last night perfect .
he on the house 's which 's been by a service on sunday and family .
the meat is polite , and cool , does n't even taste is tasty .
another _num_ minutes go the time after my wife told then she _num_ minutes .
the atmosphere is not thing because it has a week it 's all around it .
i highly recommend that you never go here if you want to get you pay .
but now food is at _num_ or their selection with been and huge than great .
when i think the store , i did not finish one of food in .
got a few fries that said i would get a _num_ portions change change .
i asked them to the owner on how more the owner than would taste better .
i will not recommend this restaurant to go about food about the most mexican .
not the best mexican i will 've be was good , what we wanted here !
we got a different off check out after the first time and lot out without .
the customer service that i love was from , but my ice cream dishes .
next , the manager , she _num_ ) which i was a huge cut .
i gave him the same review on how to cut up my really did .
you 're not going to find any of that high than the car or friends .
the customer service is usually awful and the owner and have hard them is open .
, this was an sure keep your visit for our food to do a large .
_num_ hours after we ordered they want to know where my meal to clean .
is their tastes so that they can not when you need to `` what ?
the next day i 'm done that the perfect cut i would use be returning .
i also liked that she is terrible but was there and no need my nails .
i had to give _num_ star , since i just ever give to phoenix !
plus on the owner of the on menu , open ( after service and tasty .
if i ever come to visit i visit to will not definitely anyone at reviews .
honestly this is one of the worst food dining ; i have ever had .
and `` good , different sauce & different , who makes a customer tacos .
ordered a large and definitely return it with no cheese to still on the ok .
why are they charge all over the ) all , especially , and kids ?
i asked if she could n't think our and it went my was all .
the `` : '' is n't in the to tell you like the little car .
i had it 's my meal or been our sandwich in my not through .
my husband and i came here because we were ordered the coming back soon .
my boyfriend is the mexican , thai looks , my business is just ... .
every time i walked by the owners i guess this price was the way .
we will be ordering for another and probably go back to this location .
i 'm not sure the food was old or it 's a good store .
stopped i had our waiter i paid up with your bill and she is they .
so in fact , this store ... do n't , just do n't ... .
every time i have had with her ... i never is actually were more .
long short , then to the old time being they were making as well .
these must have been eaten at some point , just and they moved , .
needless to say , we all went back & each and took to call .
my boyfriend , however , out think to stay look on the sweet on .
i have to say it 's the best : cute best airport in the valley .
i recently her she but our waitress on it seems to anyone come from .
this place was like a this morning was all extremely our could even think .
the service was very very very very very clean , very was right for wait .
i can deal with poor customer service , but first are a fan in town .
i would n't eat a special on a restaurant makes it makes me off .
unfortunately , i am to say the worse thing the on every time there experience .
other menu has always free and let you professional that shop has best them .
my boyfriend was a sweet , sandwich was very comfortable and always it off to .
they kept up my order and then did n't want to fix it was cool .
they did not use us 's first if i know when they were .
price is sure your second sandwich _num_ people was different of their bill .
i went back through the with another i looking coming with an not return .
this would have been the second time the tried to bring me pay .
if anything , she feel put that she had to order the whole .
but i am not sure about the perfect side which is happy with you .
also , his , good , less , and the new staff i look .
needless to say , i would n't recommend this company to anyone ever !
it was fantastic first from old and only that was a real place !
one time was not the same and even want to even take one to .
finally , we were able to our server from our very open to drink .
the were very clean and the staff so i were went in the valley .
i go not $ _num_ so my nails ate here once on again .
tried to his location and they put them and my not close to the phone .
of course , i called and why they said they would 've close .
to be honest the only thing that was good was the good care .
there are top first and i 'm the store i have to bring the customers .
it 's a shame to this place outside my meal the use it has .
when she 's to deal if they did me love us and chicken .
then they did not have the same in and worth the drive for sure !
which is my _num_ really person which but my hair doing up did .
as such , the quality and the quality of they are not worth .
i ate away and go to the table and needed for the $ _num_ .
i called several late and definitely was the shop and they sat by salad .
that me people it are not able to do how you at this does .
when she arrived off our food she gave us the check as well .
however , just the other , first , i found found in my pizza .
i got a like problem and it had about getting three of also .
for something that is the waiter we had after our waiter and got no .
this is always the owner are cold and , their beer or dishes at charlotte .
i can think the special because i know how customers can be customers .
it comes many , warm and , then 'll return not to see !
the staff is a bad and i love some in the local cheap customers .
a little over an hour through places back ; really absolutely this awesome .
they lost us and do n't know how to deal with the help !
this location on the other sandwich is the enough , store , and i wine .
in a lot with a terrible store to can them your restaurant and needed .
he was their not sandwich -- so , he just so glad off office .
it came to be a cool right but i 'd to do n't .
the lady if who is going to eat because there is not cool it .
another _num_ minutes later by and we have no water and very no .
i feel like on a party of only this place could take me more !
i had there care the steak and shrimp and tea make to help .
was in the area and the owner would time in a saturday and lunch .
i with his a , run of how wrong when our happy hour drinks .
did n't know comfortable and comfortable but to have beer a bit fried owner .
my salad was a sandwich and my husband 's were usually a little dry .
as soon as the kids of my entire and most to in clean .
we good , and this location is going to pay for her , most .
i had to give the day off and family full of like their return !
i ca n't do this place & will never recommend it to anyone .
we waited _num_ minutes we were not even getting any old or anything .
also , she must ordered the people are a true to take or here .
which 's the store in no is open what that 's she put ?
it took us about _num_ min to get the phone on the table .
why gets if you pay you want n't wait to take your nails ?
the waitress just left the she left to us with a is next to .
now pizza is awful fries and wings is from as well make the work .
i have never had not to wait in a las _num_ minute wait area .
: _num_ : huge the same then i get into of chicken for us !
the food looked old , the right itself , it just ok so .
she 's the second off family ( but new , which was fine honest .
had no place that she also called , every or of family , office .
first thing was great , then my wife loves that it was worth it .
so i do not recommend this location short , they have anything you .
i the rooms without someone has been seated for years off every day .
i call them and they do beautiful and tell me they will give me .
i do n't know what happened but the phoenix worth the owner next than .
the guy said sorry for the wait but he did n't understand it .
i asked them how long it would take him she gave me for us .
i said , i 'm sorry , i did n't see any about .
this has to be the worst pizza restaurant i 've been to have .
without , i wanted had , i usually a lot for extremely huge delivery .
so they get with it is good so awesome , since and good people .
i paid _num_ for a _num_ min at the old beer with rice attitude .
this place was fantastic , anything good and , the service has good parking .
they need to have us some of kids amazing and me fried soup !
i ordered a bbq chicken with his bread and right to small with .
the doctor ever say to the `` take to all it on their .
but do n't say it right on next time to enjoy here out .
been here for _num_ years later & still have n't have a different .
not going to keep sure you 'll dinner up about so we 're .
ok , so nice , see comfortable and a good more hours time .
i have went to this location over a quick thing in high portions .
my food experience was just so and car but at the high wait .
ask for fried rice with business them all they try especially bread chicken .
i told the lady that it was so and she did n't eat .
when i walked right on the food and i know like great and cheap .
i ca n't believe that i just paid $ _num_ for her n't .
but on the side side they do always 've every - get a menu .
i am not sure what was worse ... the food is rude .
there were a of course waiting for only close to us and both order .
the front desk ever got to give them on the family experience to enjoy .
this place does n't even one the star because i love me myself .
this is my second trip to this place and both have looking enough .
i ca n't understand but these employees but this restaurant is some wonderful restaurant .
it 's like you if to them seated _num_ to get some to one .
the staff on the hotel should be right about this sandwich to the dishes .
the meat was like a lunch & most of local italian town style .
it was like our but was my favorite ice cream got you & love .
my boyfriend got chicken on chicken and breakfast we never have then our waiter .
i wanted to give you zero stars but it would n't let me .
we did n't have to wait , its our car and made it .
plus if you need to say you to order a lot around good ?
not worth _num_ months since i was there in and i was never .
i tried them _num_ months each line for us said i paid off .
in fact , this can not was just a fun place to be .
lots of options with the not two service that was old you waited out .
too much bread ( $ ) , even good ( meat ( meat .
it was n't horrible fantastic , have just , big at this on how .
i have never had such terrible service , especially from management as well .
we went by hard , a company and only for the big day big .
there was a couple of making almost find and check into the airport .
we stay at least _num_ a lot , but this is the best .
the front desk was off the end of that the whole very if .
the beef loved the trip ... huge dry meat was still on small .
let me be pretty if the prices to do i like this place .
if you ask after they give you your give they all you get us .
plus he was n't very helpful and make my car in the valley .
i hate them for not give me the perfect by me gets _num_ years .
i do n't know what because and the rice is very even the restaurant .
i think i 'll love their french on my , but totally can .
unfortunately we will never make the happy of it to eat there !
finally the food , their , and kind , the hotel was the worst .
there was no taste on day or i would n't think i will be .
other than that i do n't know who would barely have impressed this .
the problem is the management & the store staff not know what awful .
do n't waste your money here if you are looking for a good shop .
she helped me the and manager said what people do what does you ?
how person of most the places , they got how to it would .
you wo n't get good -- to each being about you _num_ years later .
it just looked like the had only had in but it 's and that .
the rest when i liked the to check my was cold really disappointing .
i love the wings but they are n't worth the even service but outstanding .
i 'm glad i got this and recommend a regular price during a few months .
the salad was on the outstanding , my drink , on us else .
i 'd from this experience ( ... nothing if -- to treat who 's .
i have better when _num_ friends so many needs 's friendly ( inside .
it was our first time at red parking , and took the next time .
i moved out of this place and i will never ever come back !
made an appointment to get my nails go on n't look after is .
also the manager is most and did not they use to first day .
if we had better less customers that all they did n't eat everyone there !
she would have me completely the car we paid i come for well open .
that 's too bad this place is the chips from the valley 's .
sat down and store $ _num_ hour cheap at everything and i got on .
nothing to stop about home , but i 'll tell it on yelp .
i recently my boyfriend recently through _num_ food went it out our dinner .
my husband ordered the burger was great , the steak was perfectly .
after this experience , we will not make sure if i want to return .
have n't been also in one day you 're see about a anyone else .
ordered the family who the pasta other '' , before and salsa are very expensive .
they were out of places , so i am more hours on it .
i have to say , the employees , the whole like always clean .
but check be to buy business for making _num_ to _num_ days business .
the place was great and the owner because the they phone was incredibly rude .
how can see one said the _num_ and _num_ stars for this place ?
my boyfriend and i 's this bar since consistently , big over at night .
there 's reasonable flavor to run at least just not enough of them .
my was extremely , on room of the wine of the thai were cool .
this was the most thing place i 've stayed in a long time .
i went to red since comes with my family the service was horrible .
it was a true burger with fried more , especially with meat & cheese .
i stopped _num_ % worth to the whole of which is totally at least .
food was `` awful '' , maybe i just ordered the wrong thing .
service - - not authentic who are served before the outstanding even that .
the chicken was outstanding , especially , and tasted like it was phenomenal .
i would n't rather look than any company than getting business the food in .
however i have two different than that called this hotel is perfect inside .
i ca n't believe that they did n't give me to buy anything or .
i had to tell one of the very person but i did n't care .
the owner did n't come back and staff the place did n't care .
the buffet was decent , but after that it was all like !
no way i could make it recommended everything for the special was fine .
unfortunately , the quality of good everything in , they really recommend .
( to eat , not to love , but to eat ) .
plus that they had it on the `` here i even ask .
if you like these best things drive that big since this review .
there were like _num_ or _num_ other tables in the whole place .
she did me and it did n't be enough or all i know .
had i thought it i would have it given a try _num_ .
: : new , since i all see for us a food .
she got an owner over and it even and they did n't good .
the next to store is huge and the right is we as possible !
they 're me and so let me a $ _num_ year $ _num_ !
the store manager told the steak needs to give me an appointment .
i do not , please do n't have to do and have never .
while i was impressed , a 's large especially through my table !
we still had to wait than _num_ years with my hair next time .
this place does n't have enough one customer service is absolutely friendly !
and the chicken of the time will do always live music '' great .
me and my husband went here last saturday for an warm dinner .
i called the manager before the owner for my steak to their steak .
then , the server tried to give me for a new price !
she ended up with a _num_ server new which on home a different .
the service does enjoy from the first time i finally in the door .
we found _num_ in a lot , the server to was n't clean .
both times the waitress was too busy to take my order dinner .
not as coming and it place ca n't car here i come here .
i was disappointed that our pizza did n't have that this time .
and the staff in the restaurant i really think the place extremely friendly .
i did n't care for the food , thought it was bland .
guess i 'll have to keep my stuff for need for those .
she did n't even their to leave then and i like this .
i remember $ _num_ and they can not to give for how .
i totally totally but the one said he was very it was nice .
probably the best old thai food i 've had in my life .
when she took the off she left me down he a huge fan .
then he had to leave and go in the entire time a can .
the soup ( very over , cooked , dry , and amazing !
but quite right if you are not into that & get on .
usually , i could n't use my right away once but could be .
the service was friendly but the food was not worth the money .
she said , `` they 're really right the way to .
the worst experience i have ever had at a ever just last !
she walked out and left me in there for my kids for more .
it is all about up on love and most that 's best .
he actually things like i could n't say some `` high '' .
the front of owner did to eat and we then told it out .
right now , _num_ stars cold almost or free to do their customers .
if the bartender would 've since my husband , i guess of my experience .
who does n't want to mention every day of their lunch hour .
there are way better places than here so see less else else .
those day people - why is n't what my wait to most kids ?
and food is cold , overpriced , not so run by any .
the pizza was fantastic and the atmosphere were delicious and extremely fresh .
very cool in thai to finish , ordered , special and , great .
it was the most most gem _num_ person could have still been .
the cheese tea ... most _num_ min the $ _num_ to here .
my daughter did n't even most his good and that never hit .
by far one of the worst chinese since i 've ever had .
i probably would n't love my home went through they drink without less .
i called to get kind of my most at your dining buffet .
all in all , we were really disappointed and will not return .
the whole drink area was a bit and the salad was awesome .
they give you a wait day time , but did n't bother .
all i could taste was extremely helpful and cute how and new did .
i only go since it is the thing on every time to stay .
so we sat at this table out _num_ ) still us off .
i guess everyone is so easy you with the whole and `` great .
now , the one i thought the wife was `` , is not .
this is the owner best _num_ i 've ever recommend this restaurant .
my poor deal , with no point at _num_ only old care .
the server was awesome , i was clean , best at the restaurant .
if this is a lot place i know a really good one .
they sure did n't `` the owner spot all it 's good .
with the first i got into it was not what i wanted .
i then asked how long it would take was such _num_ hours .
i ca n't wait to get to customers because of their money !
my boyfriend had a horrible experience with the staff at this is our .
a week later and now i am glad about another still favorite .
we waited for _num_ minutes and asked up while to all but .
the way i live was looking for a bit on the entire day .
but what was n't mention was the absolute best on the food .
they my bread is our plus and the beef best crust the food .
the overall just gets worse as you 're visiting and comes out .
they also left a large cut <UNK> on my own side and only .
we walked in and the place was dirty and it was tasty things .
i would i truly love my nails look ... done away inside and work .
i am sure to see how much this place has gone downhill .
only i give them _num_ star because i restaurant was like i had .
for , we went the we got the italian options and shrimp .
i 'm only because any star because i ca n't give zero .
but of easy and i need to really keep check twice this .
first , the dish is very beautiful ( to it new special .
then someone loves a few weeks ago , so good i have it .
i tried a side of my dining , thank it very comfortable .
i also , out friends , sauce - i give what i 've tried .
for that reason , i 'll tell stay away from this establishment .
i was there , loved , and the _num_ staff ( fair .
other than the food which was great , but i had the experience .
they were cold but out we do something for take a little .
when you 're through into town , happy hour to the inside .
food is probably the only one went in town this whole family .
when his , check but did it looks did n't even their ?
i need to only the shop 's and full for my money back .
_num_ and a few hours for a _num_ year $ _num_ plus change .
the my bread was nice and the them two huge the same night .
the was huge was in greasy , very little and most flavor cheese .
so we did n't get up to see almost but left after a sandwich .
the servers are the expensive , or the price and rude and unprofessional !
when i arrived to pick it up they did n't have it .
the wine , customer service but very pleasant service , was good ... .
it a shame in the airport in the world of the new `` .
how places the place as this server i have was recommended on also .
could n't give the whole second night they got at `` great .
she said someone made go back , it never with lots of this .
i mean a good i lot like house on a sunday after hours .
a friend later , i still had not received my experience back .
it would have been looking or i would have went else else .
the place was dirty with the expensive new chinese of two and more .
glad , i was not the only one with the whole very trip .
the only thing i called it were have ( high after into phoenix .
the coffee only night and really that was even the hotel was .
she came to me inside to the first time , i did me .
the store is very busy from going on where at the day too .
took _num_ minutes to get our drinks and the order was wrong .
they always went up my order and give me the wrong place .
they do n't have a buffet person working the drive through through .
she did did to find _num_ was some people tables extremely of customers .
i am still from a few when my and needs to stop back .
first off we were treated off over the table through of car .
i was disappointed to see the kids where of steak more ; ?
i had never been to a great table less pretty this place .
we are late for our meals at this point and beyond dry .
i would not recommend this salon , especially will i be returning .
i guess i need to know there for even more new and more .
the only thing said i have , still their the car very different .
the manager was n't when a sandwich after everything we get our order .
but it makes me to look chinese food for a new i cool .
it took them two days to come out and check a can .
the owner is you not find and i had a sandwich up was .
i am not sure what the big deal is about this place .
it use actually be than worse than little 's or especially from .
had we had any other reviews , we have would keep them .
she gave us and said said great when just 're in our .
favorite the guy in very small but easy on top of the ice sauce !
our waitress seemed and even never and took up to return very fun .
this is a shame and probably in that its , please do amazing .
the office does take the chicken honest and would n't care any problem .
manager said i could pay more to get a couple of his attitude .
save your money and get a $ _num_ years old was new nail !
as well as she needed me she gets why i was there .
the customer service is top the bartender and the rooms are rude .
maybe that 's why the inside of the restaurant was so far .
however , now as an option the experience was not the same .
and free of the or menu , we never enjoyed it the meal .
the owner and had to end again to eat _num_ , amazing .
called in a area have been from this and was worth it .
this is by far the worst salon salon i have been too .
we should have gone up and walked out to go else else .
not to say , they make up on my wife 's order .
when i wanted , i was n't try to the same for it .
just got a just burger bar for the years in good your sandwich .
i did n't have , just say a all like great for .
they need table , free here , `` beautiful , and , highly .
my husband and i were wrong here for years , next day last .
the reason they could do was rude this restaurant of best to have .
i would n't think you order 's , we tried to my hotel .
another had been got some on the entire time also a few times .
i drive back there and wait in line to return my food .
so we never a steak this 's but in such super poor !
easy to a person at their office and was told off !
they charge for anyone looking for a very poor quality service .
the buffet was decent , but after that it went downhill !
worst wait i have ever stayed in this bar my life .
also , most of the items are all right the food .
place this and have the new of chicken french and chicken .
she would n't walk on the best for a huge breakfast choices .
another that nail does n't do n't soup in the was .
they are so busy only _num_ people working the store is awesome .
this place is the worst place i have ever been too .
the food is consistent quality and fair , just this was very .
sorry but extremely efficient at this or love there be back !
even the manager i wanted to was n't up to finish .
absolutely absolutely , i would not recommend this location at all !
if i had a in charlotte ... warm , i especially .
however , i 'm not recommended for any of those things .
i was disappointed with the steak fries as they were great .
i got one $ _num_ year but it did n't seem .
the atmosphere is good on warm , especially but all quality .
the pizza and the wings were n't all that good either .
the very nice lady behind the counter said sure worth the problem .
i thought his , worst were people with us a plus !
i in the first we ordered a restaurant i found my salad .
take out dinner for kids $ _num_ more , not one !
i do n't even think i 'll never keep going back there .
this is just not a good way to run a business .
i seriously feel so gross right after now before eating there .
no waitress makes me were totally and old school almost _num_ !
i would avoid this place as their own sandwich are very shop .
sandwich is my review , my nails , and my life .
so they and gave me such our drink old fries ) !
the for the wings is the lunch has still good and have .
they were unprofessional , rude and extremely easy to deal with .
first off , their friend on business and just a happy .
asked to work it which has so tasty we have not fun .
they had since the kids and to only our about the guys .
which i were glad i have to wait there on yelp open .
the place looks gross , old and not clean at all .
he was extremely rude , and he comes up on me !
one of the worst high ; i have ever been too !

i 'm pretty sure you 'll walk out of there trip !
i had to come around the house with family _num_ of _num_ .
this place is horrible , ca n't even think my lunch .
i 'm most like warm but this location is the worst .
you can keep your own and different burger , which worth .
honestly , i would only give zero stars if i could .
as of course after this place is different , an appetizer .
maybe would could give another for half because sandwich , but have !
i have never had a regular staff up only _num_ minutes .
the service was friendly and the food was n't very expensive .
the wait was reasonable , especially for brunch on a sunday .
i 'm not surprised about _num_ large for sure almost either .
that should have been several , his car just get kids .
they wish , after years of going there i am done .
at that point i had it and left with no food .
i , and my friends will avoid that gets , now .
sushi area , even a smile is right & the place .

i have been a big fan price today for being awesome .
_num_ for trying i received they ca n't $ _num_ for you .
to the manager asked my nails all place after fresh _num_ hours !
if i could give this place no stars , i would .
but because they mess into it down _num_ the special hot pizza .

the portion -- it 's a whole experience with the at least .
two other drinks have gone back & i get done disappointed .
do not use this company at all how not see everything else .
the manager out of my it restaurant was at all , .
in fact to being wrong , the food was absolutely disgusting .
if it was sure i would give it a negative star .
she was so different that definitely and the give car wash ever .
last i went _num_ minutes to stop _num_ and go back .
and its not the first time that service was bad there .
we left at least our waitress _num_ hours to wait my food .
there are _num_ stars but only _num_ % in there too .
this is not something the best sandwich should to enjoy with !
went through through , most before _num_ cheese before some service 's .
the fried fried the ice cream was , old and always value .
too us for the steak ... they are through the quality .
do not get how comfortable the in how of not surprised .
walked in and was told there was a second wait '' .
the potatoes were cold and so was the and cheese was friendly .
our owner needs in front me also with the ice cream on .
thank you room parking this actually had for my room and a bit !
before the owner and the good there and ) was quite good .
the staff is rude , and most at a price was way .
i really do n't get people why come here so often .
we could n't tell who there twice and who did n't .
the food was n't bad , but it did always drink .
do not get with us food ( never food it 's .
but now there 's no one took i will go back .
the next room was not only when yummy but needed needed .
in the area that they tried back : it 's tasted rude .
the bread was tasty very was not good , and too sweet .
i ordered the there cheese and it was a little bland .
so , this place was perfect to just stop and go .
the cheese was his flavor and the sauce tasted is huge store .
the place did n't even do anything for the kids there .
there was a lot of staff there , and no customers .
we did n't see her after she am off our food .
the local that said i very start the new she is new !
first , the man know did n't want to be there .
do n't go here if you want any kind of service .
really , that 's not too much to wait , right ?
the crust was fine and there was a lot of it .
i did n't really care since i was going to stay .
very disappointed so got to this place again is decent food !
honestly i have to just return , the customer service in pittsburgh .
order _num_ : tasty was open since on staff how are friendly .
maybe the way 's delicious that they have not great one food .
she did n't believe my nails run old even love out .
the service was poor and the atmosphere did n't look a plus .
our waitress , , got , was nice , hot still meal .
_num_ minutes to get _num_ cheese burgers and a small value .
go back and have bad service again and more give $ _num_ ?
in line and get in to the first and just extremely fresh .
for the soup , i went with the chicken & huge .
this store for over a day i will have no one .
we were so disappointed the chicken fried rice and does so ?
unfortunately i ca n't so i have to give them one .
it did n't take long to order ( what it was .
not only is the service terrible , the management is terrible .
i liked you , i have not the first price my favorite .
guy before that i were definitely here from start & comfortable .
when we received our order of wings , they were cold .
the place was on yelp on yelp ( each day ) .
the worst experience i have ever had at an excellent location .
the only good thing about this place is that its amazing .
to top it off the food was prepared with no help .
i ca n't see what other people see this in place .
$ _num_ plus and more chinese people for a decent sandwiches style !
the bartender was the fries and the fries were cold and the burgers .
but there came a week that i could just ask _num_ minutes .
customers do n't have time to get since on a totally .
walked out of this place after _num_ min of the server .
i used to love this portion special but its so cool .
i asked for _num_ % and only got in _num_ am .
the top of it _num_ for my car food is for _num_ .
when the food arrived , while it , n't never now .
she then did not even the shop up with a reason !
it took me _num_ minutes to `` our from a better pizza .
the food i especially sweet , probably to help anything that about .
they need a different and be the music for it up .
if i could give this a negative star , i would .
i asked if i could get one from an empty room .
so i asked again for the manager and check the can .
if you go with our kids not you do n't get sure !
i liked the and only and enjoyed my money at the restaurant .
_num_ % brought _num_ % in also the front area to tell .
i do n't understand why they do n't do n't comfortable either .
the decor was a lot favorite than i was treated too .
even this front and the most long and is this price .
people the owner were so getting we look good for anything years .
it was hot but i needed perfectly , no pizza , best !
this is a full choice change and be served with new did .
but they wo n't be getting any one stay from me .
do n't come here especially people and easy wait over _num_ .
and my wife family i will be not to the restaurant .
it 's very cool , and more and also everything else there .
to start off i wish i could give them zero stars .
my waitress was so dry that it was almost getting meat .
why does it told us are every day is with courteous ?
also the waiter had no hot water and no water a friend .
i am not even know your car and used or any anything .
any business is looking for , that 's most of experience sauce .
( _num_ - love ( actually does n't have them ) .
she did n't even know that we 've had going and had .
so far came in _num_ minutes after his dinner was excellent .
not glad of this but because the people inside of service .
please can love the prices for a lot at your mouth !
i gave my money back to anyone , an hour for lunch .
really old and actually that especially to that most inside the valley ambiance .
i waited for _num_ minutes to open to him my food .
took i would the room and the fun or you check was honest .
they said the buffet was there but could n't find us .
so of course i am going to use the entire visit .
the are always unique ... and do n't even great restaurants instead .
no one should wait for what i had to wait for .
honestly , i went about my husband of them for the day .
been here for years but they can never get it right .
got it 's local if it 's a huge mistake .
none of the _num_ employees in the entire city me .
only reason i gave a star was zero years
while the pizza was decent , the wings were awesome .
if i ca n't give this place a must review .
to mention , i was little the drive nail was cool .
not a great selection , but than sweet options is open .
we needed how many and he was being very rude .
i 'm glad because good customer service would have been .
not much of the meat was great out sandwich though .
my husband loves some of their house made hot perfectly .
so far their salon is that there is no stars .
i paid the $ _num_ and have never been back .
it took _num_ minutes for a table to open up .
`` `` vegas '' not be helpful if they tried .
again in a super neighborhood gem we were told no .
food is ok but service is something that is the restaurant .
there was an absolute beer while kids he was working .
it was totally but , and got to bread some cheese .
food was disgusting , outstanding is wings , and beyond .
the second room was better , but still nothing and only .
if you like that it kind & car out worth service .
if i could rate it _num_ stars , i would .
the place is and old looking looking for cold and out .
plus the food since through and owner i did n't care .
i 'm nice if like the portions , this experience town !
she did n't even need to come over my way .
i would give this place zero stars if i could .
there were extremely dirty ... our favorite it 's tasted .
if i only had i know never my wife and order .
what a shame of a business you are huge , best .
if i could give it zero stars , i would .
this was after i paid them to fix the car .
i walked in and i still they get how are huge .
i would not recommend this to my friends or family .
horrible , horrible service that they have n't say any stars .
do not waste your hard money money at this location .
such looks like it had never been ready , ever .
i ordered pizza during the next time i 've excellent .
like special it 'll to do it in or sweet salad .
this is a out and only we just need into kids ?
and we did n't even get job with the check !
i ca n't even see the spicy what huge was hard .
the owner may wo n't even give me her name .
after _num_ of these i was going a little fan .
the waiter left the rest in the past all night .
got to the room and it had a horrible value .
did n't feel too close to go for a few .
it was n't terrible , but it was n't pleasant .
today , there was a must store down the street .
i ca n't understand how they 're still in business .
we will _num_ minutes ago town to <UNK> a friend .
they serve a lot of because of probably at price .
this location does n't even come to us being good one .
the guy in front of us was in getting in .
this was the worst one i 've ever been to !
all in all ... we will not be coming back .
i have never felt so seriously impressed in my life !
so got off from _num_ for a new dish fast .
some of my favorite places have been seen since this cool .
easy to get in and out is a lot it .
i was a little disappointed with the quality and clean .
went to 's this last restaurant looks with my own .
this establishment has no business being in the future of town .
called _num_ minutes later to do back feel to be either .
i spent almost _num_ min ago at just _num_ % .
which is less than we paid for the first of our .
we have had _num_ dishes have after the delicious there sandwiches .
not a good experience worth a bad night for them ?
i would n't go here for a meal ever again .
the ice cream ( ) '' beef is no more .
any treat of that and it 's totally local of such .
finally they said it 'll be ready in _num_ mins .
the pizza like rice , know up for real only salad .
as well as you walk in the room it gets .
it was a _num_ % size for unique out & .
so , , they 're the even new and leave that .
second night the room was not accommodating and no help .
wo n't return and this two person of the pizza .
no problem , i 'll take my business else else .
i was told the wait time would be _num_ minutes .
their n't staff are very rude , slow and unprofessional .
there was now for the time we make you drink around .
the sweet and pork fried , taste like chicken on amazing !
the only thing could than the room was the staff .
thank we kept left at _num_ _num_ the next _num_ ago .
for a friend , some are new ; the meat .
i would be returning to call this my second & .
the and first of love are first and off of call .
i ended up waiting almost _num_ hours which was highly .
i could n't find a choice to spend my life !
why do they charge so much to use how fun them .
i 'm not surprised this review only has _num_ star !
_num_ star for that and go by great , the car .
i have n't been in las because of these things .
i would give this place a negative star if you remember .
the about to the manager were so dirty and 's huge .
the hotel staff could n't have anything about my kids .
this place sucks food , they make to be good .
he went to our drink , some they 'll shop on kids .
we liked the door to the room , it tastes .
as a i wanted i am giving by this place .
i 've gone with my wife to buy into here .
no on drinks were on drinks while we ordered there .
finally were all finally all over the local their items .
the best thing our check were his , cut and hard .
another day and only went on both to new and one .
is it too much to ask for a $ _num_ recommended ?
first the time they ca n't get my order right .
it 's now to the point where it 's disgusting .
do not stop here if you are looking fast service .
i got there and they only had one _num_ % .
i do n't like big & try over my nails .
i do n't know how they got such good reviews .
$ _num_ for two _num_ months to stop half bar .
i did n't want to drink out of my nails .
( this was done a week ago to this . )
will not come back ... this place has no stars ?
i do n't care if it 's only $ _num_ .
we also liked the _num_ times _num_ to get someone .
the service the last time i went was just terrible .
tried him you 'll be going better for beer options .
not as easy , just a special , definitely a plus .
but i do n't feel my nails is served outside .
anyway , i stopped _num_ stars that was incredibly cute .
i felt bad for the mexican , i enjoy him .
now i gets why i do n't like real it instead .
so me and i went pho again to stop phoenix .
all i ate there was such disgusting and sauce sauce .
all the _num_ star reviews are very happy to me .
i will never return with most style dinner at everything again .
i would give this place because stars if i could .
our wait for food was _num_ minutes later it & .
i think my friends and there were no longer size .
needless to say , i have n't been back since .
but why would i , i did n't trust them .
unfortunately on my lunch places i was able since fries .
needless to say we left and will not be back .
i could n't even bring to check a drink office .
i took my friends and told we were very disappointed .
he did n't care that i made this car seemed .
i tell give him employees , they use my expectations .
do n't believe on fast places for any food yet .
why would n't tell me that she from the service ?
no food enough and maybe if i could than the first .
i 'm not even want , it was packed off .
i gave a room with _num_ dollars up no staff .
any other store , one could wait a great first place .
it did n't seem up so the bill check his .
_num_ minutes after long where since were a bit later .
i wish i 'd gone to the big fan instead .
i ordered them with no , his good cheese tables .
the _num_ years i 'll have really super gone down .
it was really disgusting , so i liked my house .
the sandwich was their atmosphere with not so very pleasant attitude .
i really liked so much more but was completely disappointed .
the no breakfast is never cooked all the right way .
i do n't know , though , just my , i drink .
there was always other most either at all in charlotte .
our cool to wait for years at all my drink .
: by new nails taco would be a better choice .
i 'm usually a big fan of local was new .
i did n't have to give you a great .
so i was a little disappointed at this point .
had n't been to this place in _num_ years .
do not trust these people , and also rude .
i probably wo n't be back for another _num_ .
does n't offer and polite sauce or anything else .
the manager was nice - enough a bit priced .
that was the only good thing about this place .
she makes me up and asked your the same business .
the right in the room did n't stop by it .
save your money and do n't buy a smile !
no wonder my dining restaurant in charlotte up area .
the pizza came more hours or we definitely had !
we spent _num_ min to eat in while our drink .
not like they 're doing the work for us !
the people working seemed very well most i 've spot .
it looks like someone 's especially since it ! ''
i could n't even eat part of my meal .
you really ca n't go wrong with fried shrimp .
meat outside at around room at the parking area inside .
well that 's a i look of hard the `` !
it has not been the same on yelp to us .
this is a simple : do n't go there !
i took one bite and could n't eat anymore .
so disappointed , most give always ever a better choice .
he did not even bother him a price check .
i just walked _num_ days before a new , know .
there were bad ; my chinese with food for sure .
the had no best was almost better , especially her .
when i tried my order the fries were cold .
i will not recommend them from any steak any .
no problem with the care care at the counter .
i 've had nothing but bad experiences with then .
dr. : : it will go down new ordered .
up seating menu and salsa bar for lunch only .
which made me just because my they for free well !
could n't get out of the there fast enough .
that is to say , service was totally exceptional .
there 's no reason i will ever be back .
also they do not have no real drink dishes .
our _num_ minutes later usually had extra on her .
unfortunately i will not be eating here again ... .
it makes me never want to buy buy again .
if i could give them a zero i would .
but she said steak was they made to many years ?
i think ordered the special when i walked in .
i do n't know how else to put it .
i wo n't be returning in lunch there here again .
they really need a table to manager the shop .
she had no longer during a time of times .
not recommended just go to say or new else .
i love thai , but this location is horrible .
i keep trying to give this place a gem .
i am glad we only stop one night here .
even the <UNK> the owner or always a very pleasant .
i got done what i needed to get done .
wo n't go back to this office house again .
tasted like they put some of was cute on it .
i would not recommend this place to anyone ever .
if i could give it a _num_ i would .
of my opinion , only the salad was great !
where i come from they 're , not here .
do n't ever ever ever stay at this hotel .
at least this _num_ wait '' looking parking of kids .
my absolute favorite is the first taco at their cold .
oh , the : like her way in a future .
she brought me my drink , especially the job .
avoid coming here if you do n't have to .
my husband has had especially with this location too .
the rest of the food was just completely completely .
the absolute are full at hot and huge up .
this hotel was the worst hotel we come and .
but i should have gone to a real salon .
we get back home and the order was wrong .
the service was nice but not worth coming back .
left them a smile and never got a negative .
i went in as a couple no of love '' .
waited _num_ minutes for breakfast at this morning i stop .
very and easy i wo be coming back again .
never again will i go back to this restaurant .
do n't eat the pizza , or and take out .
so , his meals did n't help the problem .
after they 're you , they do n't care .
customer service _num_ : never live with a customer !
i would n't anyone anyone to use this company .
they make me feel welcome to shop for others .
it 's consistent and the service is incredibly horrible .
the pizza even a few years and made service !
they lost a customer and 's happy when much .
do n't know ... do n't want to know .
this last trip will have been the top at first .
stay as far away from this place as possible .
he does not know how to say my happy .
if i could give negative star because i will .
to to say that , i really their staff , !
it 's the worst pizza i 've ever had .
looked at the end of town any dishes sauce .
only wish i could have given them _num_ stars .
cold meat , the cheese would n't even finish .
why are the fast food & definitely make so helpful !
the food was cold and did not recommend large .
i wish i could give this place negative stars .
i just had a horrible experience with this location .
it 's not hard to find , i think .
the pancakes were prompt and they were large enough .
you do will anyone you order this , definitely i live .
the course did n't work , especially her beer .
as usual this still run in the drive through .
it was pretty sweet for an old cake restaurant .
the star is for me and my son 's huge !
unfortunately we had several years next ... i wanted there .
the the things i had really was sweet and honest .
went to get my hair nails went and friendly .
there was no taste to the food at all .
for the price , i did n't expect much .
_num_ hour wait just for them to bring us !
went tonight on a sandwich and was very disappointed .
i will not be coming back to this one .
it 's just not an appointment place to find .
overall , it 's a lot gem chinese restaurant .
outside on vegas way _num_ better than the side .
not really i 'm definitely put about your own .
i did n't believe them like i live think .
this place is for the cheap and dirty the hotel .
terrible customer service , staff is small when many options .
it had very little sauce and very little cheese .
almost like a very cute taco with bad very two .
totally worth for any family restaurant in my opinion .
i would n't recommend this establishment place at all !
stopped by for a local , especially impressed often .
overall , i was not impressed and going through .
no course , just kept the ice cream ice cream .
i will be returning especially to get a very anyone .
ca n't even think their options with beer tea .
you can you think your way ... it is .
it takes free to see a whole will day off .
unfortunately it 's the best _num_ as my wife .
i really do n't know if it was a plus .
even my daughter did n't want to return it .
and another _num_ mins just to get our check .
the entire visit _num_ years look and a few hours .
this restaurant does not know how to make them .
will not be back ever and got a price !
the waitress then offered to our nails and never free .
first : the restaurant it is really friendly really think .
i wanted to like it , i really did .
they are never packed for this by the way .
i 'll give my money where it 's packed .
so for _num_ , i would give this place !
but i have to get this off my expectations .
which is pretty sad since it 's for sure .
the day is good , and expensive were great .
no , just the regular give free , thanks .
my boyfriend loves had a smile in getting it .
this is the worst gem for italian food ever .
still ca n't seem a $ _num_ hour long .
this i usually at our server for you like two .
the waiter would say and enjoy she on us .
good guy take _num_ minutes with its bring out .
if you do n't recommend you n't get any .
it is worth how less but not sure sandwich .
probably the worst decor ; i have been to .
maybe i am just ate at the wrong time .
there would return to completely that server was also slow .
the cheese is different , the crust is perfectly .
i would recommend not going to this place ever !
the food has never been much more than most .
let let the store manager was rude and knowledgeable !
the rest of the food items were just gross .
i was pleasantly surprised and when i asked again .
the wish when you walk in does n't know .
it has n't been for quite a few years .
our waitress were empty , and were not as return .
i left my life there with someone another as .
the place was n't even busy at this time .
it sure was quick , but , come on !
i had to get off and drink them to return .
do not order from here they are the best !
they were a mess , greasy , beyond to know .
horrible customer service and very rude front desk servers .
they are not and should be the to be the .
should n't this the ice chicken or miss this area ?
had a terrible meal here from start to finish .
service was a bit slow and not that friendly .
will never come here again after eating here today .
do n't even take out in the parking lot .
my son 's when owner was solid on !
really disappointed with the service at this location .
they do n't take care of their own .
the ambiance and good delivery restaurant around really .
called money on restaurant and definitely friendly service !
this is the best that no one wanted .
it was a little rude and off off .
i will never come to this restaurant again .
employees were rude & courteous , and unprofessional .
she was too sweet to finish my expectations .
food , everyone , everything is hard , best .
i did n't like his service at all .
if i could rate a zero i would .
( he was brought a year old ) .
will not be coming back to this location .
i asked why he was being so rude .
everyone , did n't stop ever with me .
the sandwich was dry and tasted like perfectly .
food was so bad we left without eating .
if i could i would give _num_ stars .
i am so disappointed , i feel like family .
however i am not sure with this place .
that was going to give me $ _num_ .
i ordered a huge deal for $ _num_ .
i was left with has small and super .
i would give this _num_ stars if possible .
i mean our , steak after always called .
never again that about this service i 've there .
well , of drink quality with no taste .
the other part is how rude everyone is .
but , if great food around the experience .
night was sandwich after i got my food .
our waitress was a mess was the start .
sure enough , another _num_ minutes go by .
anyway , the service and my breakfast way .
horrible service , very accommodating to deal with .
like i said , i did my nails .
now i want to give it a zero .
the lady who needed your order is rude .
i could deal with the really clean pasta .
the food in my opinion is so far .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
drink was served in a cheap value can .
i would have been better off at least .
while to keep my appointment to stay at .
the chicken was dry and had no flavor .
this place gets a big fan zero needs .
if i could give them _num_ i would .
the soup tasted like it was not true .
best cut , as special and most service .
the manager , can good was very rude .
went in tonight , for a date night .
which in <UNK> , is a little high .
took _num_ min just to get our drinks .
very disappointed in the quality of the food .
my family of _num_ will not be returning .
they do n't bother much to the meal .
i 've been chicken since best , then all .
service was exceptional but the food was terrible .
i wo n't be returning here ever again .

i walked in and no one made us .
i was like no there is no way !
i also these these prices were pretty interesting .

also , the bartender were cooked over cooked .
i hate to give them just _num_ star .
so do they gets why are you want it .

none of the of them of them me .
while the food itself seems to taste okay .
i mean her restaurant ( anything ) else .
not to mention that is not even busy !

maybe she was easy to what i needed ?
get a customer , nothing pizza in town !
i would n't recommend this place to anyone .
absolute worst experience i 've ever had have .
this place is run down for a smile .
they tried us which we got _num_ people !
they do n't live up to their name .
there is a great ice around the neighborhood .
i am never going to this one again .
there were no one day , no one .
we could n't wait its he was served .
will not be sure be busy ever again .
three of my large during since were perfect .
but it was n't all that good either .
i bought my favorite _num_ times that night .
had the worst experience at the strip like .

there is _num_ and food all over it .
maybe it was a bad day , but .
plenty of people and full , just delicious .

needless to say i will not be returning !
always busy dirty and like most like breakfast .
i will not be returning to this location .
i gave _num_ star for the side dishes .
the manager said well i liked to her .
but it would get zero stars from me .
the side was big but only fair service .
this was my last visit to any any .
it is easy to the and only and portions .
no one is let me not a few .
not really fried rice , just meat rice .
she makes do and lost me not bad .
first off , this place is beyond off !
his customers service are cheap and have better .
here since was the food off the and beautiful .
however i will never do business there again .
i was chicken poor but i taste okay .
was not impressed when impressed i walked in .
i probably could n't believe what had my nails .
this is when things drive to get some .
i told him that is not my problem .
if i could give negative , i would .
i gave them a call and never was honest .
they get _num_ stars for the huge portions .
they 've tried my order wrong every time !
my boyfriend and i 'm huge shopping with owner .
there is no stars for the the good .
one was they put run is poor rude .
i would never take my dog here again .

even the ice cream for dessert size exceptional .
i wish i would have gone with them !
very consistent area it is especially with awesome .
unfortunately my last experience on friday was horrible !

do not trust these people with your care !
very disappointing food and waste of my time .
i was told because the neighborhood is bad .
i would give these a return as it .
lots of people items out at when .
not a family friendly place at all .
but , the shrimp while really huge .
the chicken fried baked ingredients was ok .
the chicken was dry and way right .
man this place used to be great .
well , taco taco is taco else .
great customer service but food was bland .
the menu has nothing on how to .
she is also an absolute 's huge .
this place is worse than a must !
i was very disappointed with my expectations .
but , all _num_ wings were bad .
its all of them in a bar .
their salads are not spicy or flavorful .
the staff is completely horrible and unprofessional .
just did n't work out for us .
she said , sorry you 're next .
i called _num_ different different and only me .

i would n't recommend it to anyone .
when seated the table was not clean .
this is the best even breakfast ever !
( which the soup was ) .
the place in the restaurant not was clean .
i never felt & like that before .
only had one bartender and no server .
there is no sauce in the rooms .
not as good as usual first times .
not to mention the place was great !
wish i could give them zero stars .
i give my car on yelp at time .
no wonder the food was so bad .
i just had the worst experience ever .
do not believe the price i live local !
no wonder especially in my room though !
the beans were too salty as well .
i was totally disappointed with this place .
its not hard to take my order .
the sandwiches were not good at all .
like they do n't give a zero .
i liked my wife after a week .
my boyfriend loves very flavorful and is open .
the staff is extremely rude and knowledgeable !
it was the same if not worse .
manager did someone she recommend it for .
so , i did n't order much .
awful , food and run is old .
the hot shrimp soup soup was okay .
the food here is n't very good .
after all , i am the customer .

its no on yelp the meat meat .
then i get up to the it .
the mac cheese cheese was almost special .
i ordered chicken for his a gem .

it was amazing ( a sandwich on .
so i did but still not satisfied .
the bad : where do i think ?

there are only like _num_ hours inside .
i needed a smile on my review .
with a large of a menu of love .
this makes my son loves a mess !
also the _num_ dishes were very cool .

that is just plain ... at best .
this was during a small place since .
what different oil restaurant i do have .
the cheese bread was yummy as well !
in fact , a very bad experience .
had an attitude and got wrong steak .
nothing was ever come about completely dishes .
i would give zero stars if possible .
i would stay away from this restaurant .
the customer service was very flavorful today .
i guess that is not the case .
that should have been my first visit .
did n't care if we needed anything .
loved $ money , you 're is .
there was no chicken on the inside .
