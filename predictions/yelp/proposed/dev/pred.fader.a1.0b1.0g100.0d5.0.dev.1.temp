by far the worst dining experience i 've ever had in my entire life .
i was so glad to find a place i felt like for their bar .
very wonderful we 'm out , as too many trying to choose from ingredients .
to make worse airport , the place has all the flavor and a selection .
i bring up a few minutes or still and another only clean one .
when you pay for your order her from anyone after money with your table .
called because this morning at least for a took an appointment for an oil change .
finally it with a bit i tried and a bland salad , that 's how .
i used to love the green , however this , the company is completely .
after he had just moved there waiting for her for over _num_ minutes .
my husband and i went to and we went to treat the drive through .
very glad when he asked if he have me our while everyone else .
it was easy to shop because there is not right when in the kids .
even when they about and should be trying to get trying of their food .
long time business should n't care ... both done in for long a time .
i asked for a place to go with a waitress over and shrimp .
i 've stayed at other super _num_ hours and it was n't like this .
he was helpful at first or real at these bring we were not there .
i will never be back to mention shop and parking have to buy extra .
i was told that i would have to wait over a week for him .
she was not a fan of the she had when the salad and server .
my favorite beef roll was disgusting , i do n't know a better find .
i my bring and drive up and kept a regular option with seriously room .
this place did not and i was able to the $ _num_ my little .
i 've had better from other greasy sausage and crab used in charlotte .
maybe i could not wait too long and our party of us was _num_ .
needs a new star , they say that office is as i get it .
no , no food more that had fun , no salad , no <UNK> .
this place does n't want one person on my new review on yelp .
here , this dish is bland , tasteless and has no little to be .
then _num_ % away from me through when you can open if you ask me .
some absolute you 're & though would make the customer service a long better !
no one should have to wait _num_ hours early to pick a complete customer .
i recently went in to a couple of them coffee store _num_ % ) .
be treated on the phone , then up front and barely even away .
if you do n't taste so better feel that get going to be wrong .
i guess if you do n't understand how it to what $ _num_ .
they do n't seem my ( 'm _num_ ( take _num_ ) up to .
waitress asked if i would like to pick it and the if them is .
they had some things employees run but also this review if you can try .
a complete really old bar will some sweet , of their other - just good .
i had _num_ minutes to make it to the new location when they arrived .
a little more and asked more customer for someone is run in about it .
some of the are ok - definitely want and the best to go the cost .
it 's not to mention everyone has when the money your is run business .
never was waited on yelp was good next table gave us care to change .
after _num_ minutes my pizza was out but only the pizza and no wings .
glad to them this , definitely thought i think i 'll this place it .
the lady that did my husband did n't even even a few on the perfect .
she was beyond rude , even started down about us to the people .
the when ordered was way , pricey , and hot and your took over new .
which is also a place i did not go to anyone in go .
we stopped by the drive thru into from almost my little new breakfast .
by the time our food got to the table , our drinks were empty .
overall would never visit that 's experience we have is probably to you either .
i 'm disappointed to say i 'll be this one for our favorite .
the crust on a crust pizza to eat around the drive on this .
`` pricey ... ... but favorite ... helpful with how too attentive ... horrible .
i could go on and on but i am sure you get the bill .
not be how and they are pretty trying to any other definitely with sure ?
i tell him `` , why , i 'm right here in line . )
i love mexican food and was pleasantly tea tacos with cheese and chicken .
come on people , the is the and keep from an time was coming !
i asked for two a asked at his room but our room of truly .
it had only been used in _num_ well , still what he made new .
the lady that was truly well and did not care one bit way .
my wife and i thought the sauce tasted like more than their pizza flavor .
i say again , do n't ever ever ever ever stay at this hotel !
terrible customer service even asked what even are going and hit a card .
first when i called into you because the bar is not our full area .
, i think there , most there better places to eat in the area .
you get what you pay for ... stayed here to visit looking for breakfast .
there were many customer restaurants in the store , and was brought them !
food was warm that was told to be cold and chicken wings were old .
i went to 's literally 's the street and had food in _num_ minutes .
needless to say we spent too much money for a very not meal that .
the food is not cooked all the way , and , poor let did .
i took my _num_ year old into our other steak week last week .
spent and kept look like they have been hard and 'd even have on .
when we got our order it was getting asked by helped and our server .
the experience was awful and they should have more tables & his server .
i really do n't see the highly give i will ever tell anything here .
waiter was friendly , who was super nice staff and eat was all we .
going in with for a quick party to go ordered i was some they .
at the very best it should have been under $ _num_ for it all .
one time i came in on a friday and one only was working n't .
now this place is just a dive local with no way to do sweet .
anyway on my last experience i do n't think i will take my nails here ? ''
got off the only another _num_ weeks later the waitress got to our house .
it might short of the kitchen , fried chicken crust this should have something .
we waited _num_ minutes while someone looked after the other who took anyone us .
worst stay of my life , i wish i could get my money back .
i was asked for the with manager because the salad and my entire way .
i was there just as long as i am had this in the fish .
for some reason , my room had some amazing behind the hot at this .
it did n't taste horrible , well something ... no place made the only .
been dry , i am told i would have to wait after _num_ have .
the room is simple with a small large , ordered , but a restaurant .
my one take some of egg cheese to go with it was too expensive .
the waiter said i could n't take the meal than tasted it was because .
then i waited another _num_ for a that was cold when our drinks tasted .
i tried to mention and the call that really called she did n't ask .
their two hour have an option but i pay in to make for breakfast .
they really need to get some customer there , that one put to show .
make sure you have time to , my family because us another home !
i had the egg potato , bacon , and cheese sandwich and the gave .
this is the second time in a few , we will not be returning !
they looked a thanks because it from with a seriously chicken ( need .
so he refused to me my order and then _num_ minutes for the money .
after slow service this morning i went up to avoid our business on business .
i do n't want to spend three minutes of my lunch _num_ items .
this hotel was the worst i have ever stayed in and pretty very few .
, i know that could better than to order wings in this neighborhood store .
i , too many of a couple times this place since and past last night .
which my daughter was actually at almost who and a has great we 're atmosphere .
the meat is is perfect , but , does not take taste that hot .
another _num_ minutes go by i called her i told told _num_ minutes me .
the selection is mediocre about probably , it 's my favorite , friendly recommend .
i highly recommend that you never go here unless you want to get you .
but again is n't , home at $ _num_ pizza with small she at wonderful .
when i saw the store , i did not waste one of food .
got a few deal that said i would get a complete change oil change .
i asked them to put it on friday from said because that taste done .
i will not recommend anyone to food about _num_ prices of their own one .
not the best mexican since we 've been to , but it 's cheap !
we gave up on getting off our visit and us ( and two months .
the customer service that i go here was on point with any other salon .
next , the soup was $ _num_ ( i also ordered a ) pork .
i gave him the same deal on how to cut my hair like not yummy .
you 're not going to find any of that especially are full outside .
the customer service is usually awful and the onion are obviously should ever open .
sadly , it took another bite _num_ mins about , and one , & to do .
_num_ hours after we had its asked to know where to take the pizza .
is their so manager that so they can say to treat people like crap ?
the next time , we found that the water day did n't come away .
i also said that brought was really and there was no longer into told .
i had to _num_ % star , i could n't say this review !
plus plus on the the way of their bacon ( bacon and chips ) .
if i ever come to phoenix to visit i will not be returning here .
honestly this is one of the worst food dining experiences i have ever had .
, comes , or warm & his - also what 's great choices .
ordered a large portion and it had to leave waiting , even and cooked .
why they are about our nice thing the , few , service on dr. ?
i asked if she could n't fresh and my wife , i left a .
the `` sour '' is n't in the name to make it pretty busy .
i had it took for one meal and got my favorite and _num_ kids .
my husband and i came here because we were the salmon came up here .
my boyfriend is literally , once , an appointment this is just , her as .
every time i know by the place i liked they had for food .
we will be for another reason and back not coming to this back location .
i 'm not sure the food was old or it 's a food .
i had believe i left i looked $ _num_ so then love the chicken .
so in fact , this store ... do n't , just do ... .
every time i have had with her ... she is always rude or customer .
long story short , _num_ of us my hair & they have always .
these must have been taken at the side , they were tasteless and tasteless .
needless to say , we all once again and paid waiting to our entrees .
my wife , however , sour out cooked with almost on the asked .
i have to say it 's the worst -- certainly in the valley .
i kept her after it by he to make she 's best in eating .
this place was like a sandwich my name and only one even came us .
the service was very very very very very slow , and a wrong order .
i can deal with poor customer service , but live in a front ?
i would n't see it on a friday and because it helped me off .
unfortunately , i am able to say about the same back about here .
other pizza places always put away and they stopped reviews from how pizza them .
my husband was coffee , cold was thin and had no offer to .
they ended up my order and then did n't want to fix it anyway .
they did not bother anything until asked i asked if they were closed .
kept a manager can left there _num_ - then your of our bill .
i went back through the by nice _num_ weeks of it 's way too .
this would have been the second time the tried to charge me charge .
if anything , she seemed trying there to also recommend the bill .
but i am not sure about the decent sushi they should have that .
also said a restaurant , pretty perfect , and the restaurant definitely took .
needless to say , i would n't recommend this company to ever anyone !
it was two star car on how but that was a real thing !
one took was n't worth the helpful or even deserve to take one .
finally , we were able to our favorite about it looking nice we .
the owners were very clean and the server we were in was comfortable .
i am it got a about someone home was happy for _num_ here once .
tried tried to think they and he brought me to say back the .
of course , i could leave as , they said he gave me .
to be only but one thing that was good was the drinks actually .
there are three months and i see this is the worst of them .
it 's a shame to avoid this place take the it has it .
when she arrived to work i have said one were brought cheese .
then they did not have the table and the honest for our hotel !
is my daughter is our most but he took my with little she probably .
as such , the quality and the other friendly to are extremely not .
i walk away and go to the reviews or will get on .
i immediately stopped again and it tastes the in noodles and left left .
that me you are not paying , they keep to what you are doing .
when she takes off our food she gave us the money at this .
however , just the other night , i found found in my pizza .
i got like a very visit and it had three expensive of warm .
for something that was their ok and no what we left and left .
this company is always dirty , and does is how kind and tables .
i can remember the counter because it you know how could be more .
it takes many seating , and how three then no wait to do !
the neighborhood , place it and there have any reviews with everything she .
a little over an hour three days ... someone pizza horrible customer service .
they lost up and do n't know how to deal with the results !
this location on the other hand , he charge , and unprofessional .
in a city with a casual wo n't use you want your experience .
he was most was big here still , so she looked even far .
this seems to be a ordered large that give that is n't a job .
the cashier who asked is going to eat because there is not also ?
another _num_ minutes by _num_ and has no we need a professional and no service .
i feel like on a regular on them did always me out more !
i had us order the steak and shrimp with pork for _num_ minutes .
was in the area and thought i would stop in for a burger .
i with giving a room , extremely location about our happy hour drinks .
did n't offer hot and sour soup at lunch , only egg egg .
my salad was supposed and my favorite was literally a little were dry .
as glad been the whole of the one 'm were perfect in .
just and , her is food to see location for to being business .
i had to spend the day reviews and just looking on ca n't move !
i ca n't do this place & will never recommend it to anyone .
we waited _num_ minutes we were not even offered any customers or anything .
also , who said the rooms are a good came out in _num_ ?
guess is in the only sauce if that 's what we ordered ! ''
it took our order right and gave you a fan of the table .
why knows if how ca n't be places to sit through you bring ?
the waitress just left the salsa my guy is too to clean up .
now pizza is beyond awful and wings there are done by any menu .
i have never not had to wait in a long because front room .
he going room the table which did n't get out of in phoenix also !
the food looked old , the local , it looked just gross ... .
she been a couple later or an shrimp , but than i small .
had no idea it was truly forward and of places were when have .
first steak was great , then my wife loves it that was got .
so i do not recommend this location plus , they are taking out .
i the `` generous are each has been minutes or by three months .
i call them and they have paid , what i could get me .
i do n't know what happened but the whole something 's no longer .
the guy said sorry for the wait but he did n't do our .
i asked them how long it would take told me _num_ mins .
i said , i 'm sorry , i did n't see any longer .
this has to be the worst pizza location definitely is to go in .
without later , i had received a few for a large free pizza .
so they leave you with a terrible experience every , night , time .
i paid _num_ for a _num_ % so easy with a small plate .
this place was ... love : , and the food was nasty looking .
they need to make their employees some extremely , which is having away !
i ordered a chicken crispy fries with sweet and offered back to work .
the true doctor was does to help me with a smile i needed .
but do n't expect the car wash out of able to come here .
been here for about _num_ hours & still have n't loved my food .
not going to stop having having another out : we paid so hungry .
ok , all like three with <UNK> for a good job now experience .
i have went to this location over a night times for italian salon .
my food experience was just so salty and terrible at the same time .
ask for fried rice with your meal they give their chicken office rice .
i told the lady that was it and she was n't tell me .
when i first walked in , i was hit with that tastes card .
i ca n't believe that i just paid $ _num_ for her did .
but on the side side they have do hot and probably better been .
i am not sure what was worse ... the food or the employees .
there were a couple of only room to tell us in our room .
the front desk never called to check if the food had been treated .
this place does n't even deserve the one star i 'm his stars .
this is my second trip to this place and both probably too bad .
i ca n't help but why understand i should have good with most n't .
it 's like you asked them to check out when a second go .
the course is in even worse from when the came was treated .
the meat was like a terrible instead of actually without real beef .
it was like our waiter was made from three finally we felt good .
my boyfriend got chicken curry and chicken looked so we could tell everything .
i wanted to give you zero stars but it would n't let me .
we did n't have to wait very long our order was delivered .
terrible thanks do i need to need to get a drink here around ?
not _num_ minutes later it back in the time was in i was pleasant .
i saw them _num_ % small front of him were _num_ for they .
in fact , love it was just not a fun place to be .
lots of those with the not working not working and not take hot .
too people - half ( in madison but can taste ( meat ) .
it was n't horrible spicy food , just bland for what i found .
i have never had such terrible service , especially from management as well .
we walk up and wait a bit in line , no big deal .
there was a full literally a warm burger with next visit the rest .
we stay at least _num_ a lot , but this is the worst .
the front soup was off off of the that come even the that .
the beef i found our <UNK> favorite meat was that incredibly was served .
let me be busy as i can say i do like this place .
if you ask after they give you your they are another very customer .
plus he was n't very helpful with my car in the car .
i hate them for not give the what walked by the next dish .
i do n't know what but the front is it as a person .
i saw they tell they all spend on the new but who 's expensive .
unfortunately we will never make the variety of going to this location again !
finally the food comes , and of course , the order is wrong .
there was no sign or anything to say i could n't bring there .
other than that i do n't know how else could expect this place .
the problem is the management & the staff do not staff anything it .
do n't waste your money here if you are looking for a meal .
she let the me and said `` what i do know how . ''
great only most of the cheese times , they never give my call .
you wo n't get good giving trying to home about your own about .
it just looked like the had been made and had what , it 's .
the fact when i thought the door to my room was really awful .
i love the wings but they are n't worth the worst service though .
i 'm glad i got i feel good with a price extra store .
the salad was on the fun , over a busy on her price .
i 'd shop there again - not ( unless she 's too best .
i have better there with over someone 's consistently taco of bell .
it was our first time at red salads , and probably our last .
i out of doing this and i will not ever come back ever !
made an appointment to get my own thai at a night beef way .
also the manager is first , they seem they have not _num_ % looking .
if we had any other pretty , what is just have been waiting !
she would have given me completely not i had called for her pool .
that 's too bad let this is the able day to my house .
sat in sat with someone tasted just room for there were i will .
nothing to write home about , but i 'll rate it on yelp .
i bought my boyfriend moved comes to keep our lunch and being sweet .
my husband loves the soup was good and the egg roll was crispy .
after this experience , we 're not sure if we want to return .
unless has not been coming in for you see something a long night .
ordered the family - she first salad with a salad salad were decent .
they were out of pricey , so i expected more on pricey .
i have to say , i find the meat to be super helpful .
great each would be ready for two : time _num_ a less time again .
the place was pleasantly and the behind behind the counter was incredibly rude .
how else can one of the _num_ and _num_ stars for this place ?
my boyfriend and i saw this whole house , usually open , experience .
there 's , close to end at just not enough of my pizza .
my friend was cold , half of the my salad area and barely .
this was the most disgusting place i 've stayed in a long time .
i went to red lobster today with my family and the service tasted .
it was a burger stayed shrimp with highly , potato & and cheese .
i _num_ mins new last to the location but everyone is extremely bad .
food was `` `` delicious , then i just ordered the wrong thing .
service - forward : and actually working are the three after i left .
the chicken was tough , pasta , and tasted like it was phenomenal .
i would rather be less than _num_ stars only see in this place .
however i have two problems that three i 'm having a good first .
i ca n't believe that they did n't give me or taking drinks .
i had to tell one of the excellent but did n't care they .
the owner wo n't return return and the staff did n't help .
the do was decent , but after that it was all downhill !
no way i could make it takes this menu on a friday night .
unfortunately for the price of chinese had coffee the always has changed .
( to eat , not to love , but to eat ) .
that they had it at a day and did you ask much before .
if you like these chinese chinese , then `` disappointed it again .
there were like _num_ or _num_ other tables in the whole place .
she says no i 'm a but more than of that happened .
had i wish it i would have given it a _num_ hour .
: fantastic we felt , i see their more place with a .
she also got another friendly and told me they was not cold .
the drive thru is big again and the server are there rude !
they are $ _num_ in front me and a whole $ _num_ guy !
the store manager told the empty pool to give me an appetizer .
i do not , do n't have to do and were never .
while i was eating , a nice she 'd takes my table !
we still had to wait than maybe our pick up time .
this place does n't deserve any best and awful customer service is horrible !
when the service to my restaurant is out & pizza an service took .
my wife and got my family here last for an appointment dinner .
i called the most feeling the bartender to check their on me .
then , the front did take for me a lot for new !
she made up with a first visit which took on her can .
the service sucked sucked from the second we walked in the door .
we found _num_ in a timely , the rest was n't cleaned .
both times the bartender was too busy to take my order dinner .
not making this place with the probably would say here again .
i was disappointed that our pizza did n't have that this time .
and the service was great and i did n't friendly extremely friendly .
i did n't care for the food , thought it was bland .
guess i 'll have to keep to keep , for maybe taco .
she did n't take me or fish that we was that i .
i spent $ _num_ and they want me to pay for weeks .
i totally hate but the way he said it was very nice .
probably the fact that chinese food i 've had in my life .
when she took the off she left my nails still them .
then he had to leave and try and get my husband '' .
the egg roll , over cooked , greasy , greasy and horrible !
but quite if you am is so about half that of pizza .
usually , i could give my regular right than which was big .
the service was friendly but the food was not worth the money .
she said , `` they 're really disappointing at my ? )
the worst experience i have ever had at a little this restaurant !
she walked out and left me in there for half an hour .
it is all about up with our hotel and wo n't recommend .
he says things like i could n't `` quality '' `` quality .
the front desk did n't bother to and we told him so .
right now , _num_ '' cold cut of those : are _num_ .
if the whole would 've told he , i to move .
who does n't want to take every year of great lunch ?
there are better way better than love so while make else anywhere .
save yelp people - why is n't my favorite review star ?
and food is cold , soggy , not by chicken an ... .
the pizza itself was good and the wings were big and fresh .
very limited choices in need to meat , flavorful and , tender .
it was the most most experience crab thought he could have done .
the cheese itself seems much it the _num_ min , to try .
my waitress did n't even finish ice and the job : never .
by far one of the worst shopping experiences i 've ever had .
they would n't recommend it from our bill seemed these be off .
i called to help one of the employees get an appointment today .
all in all , we were really disappointed and will not return .
the whole drink area was a mess as the room was poor .
they give you a wait wait time , but did n't remember .
all i could taste was extremely seasoned and soggy because it small .
i only go since it is on the way home from work .
so we sat there for _num_ minutes before she even sat us .
i guess everyone is so used to their and big in truly .
now , the one of him i was mean , is not .
this is such the worst _num_ stars i would have ever stayed .
my poor sadly , with no flavor at only _num_ old .
the server was wrong , the food was average at best was .
if this is a great cost it is not a good one .
it simply did n't charge the day spot so to '' up .
with the first bite i took it was not what i expected .
i then asked how long it would take was _num_ hours late .
i ca n't wait to get of small one of this but !
my son had a horrible experience with the staff at this particular .
a few weeks and now i am probably about having another experience .
we waited for _num_ minutes and ended up oh with no food .
the especially was seriously the rooms for a bit on sunday did .
but what was n't working was the given burrito in the food .
they put my salad and the most beef from the amazing .
the attitude just gets worse as you 're looking and easy here .
they also left a greasy taco person from a $ _num_ am repair .
we walked in and the place was dirty and not well maintained .
i would n't tell they put too many back - working with customers .
i am sad to see how much this place has gone downhill .
only reason i gave them _num_ star is because i had to .
for several , we got the chili comes with shrimp and eggs .
i 'm only one second one because i ca n't give zero .
but lack of lack , i am looking somewhere else was solid .
first , the waiter was super late to pick up our stuff .
then someone someone for the entire whole , again so had service .
i tried a side of spicy would and very it seemed very .
i also asked for hot sauce , what i paid the manager ?
for that reason , i 'll stay stay away from this establishment .
i was there recently , and the waitress was should his server .
other than the food which was lacking , was so the service .
they were super pleasant and just `` for something a little more .
when you 're looking through food , get trying to the the office .
sadly has because the only helped _num_ stars this place kept into .
when after ordering , he was pretty he did n't me bother .
i need to take the name and ask for my money back .
_num_ and a half hours for a _num_ minute oil change change .
the lady was made and the stopped working by the small old .
the bartender was tender and flavorful , very little fried quality flavor .
so we she did get to see him but almost by far .
the rest are minutes , - a staff with but unprofessional and unprofessional !
when i arrived to pick it up they did n't have it .
very disappointment , customer service very poor and food was not good .
it a pleasure in the wall in the end of we bar .
how small the only great experience in the office i was little there .
could n't check the second room since our table did n't work .
said she 'd be back with it , never returned for breakfast .
i made a i 'm trying to stop on a after hours .
a few later , i still had not received my back back .
it would have been fine or i would have recommend else yet .
the place was dirty with quiet kept she around out of flavor .
apparently , i was not the only one with the having seemed .
the only bite i got was prices are different after hours hours .
the room took are on , but that was n't even the start .
she went is off a came on the meal , i can .
the store is very busy from & to try at other .
took _num_ minutes to get our drinks and the order was wrong .
they always mess up my order and give me the wrong food .
they do n't have a full person working the drive through .
she did continue to order a table of fries free of charge .
i still another me of them very mexican in she 's minutes .
first off we were treated over the whole order from big order .
i was disappointed to see the yelp group he ask how honest ?
i had never been to a beef quite cool like this one .
we are late for our at this point and just and expected .
i would not recommend this salon , wow will i be returning .
i guess i need to mention that out more next time .
the only thing different is that they had literally the `` actually .
the manager was pleasantly at the past who we took our order .
but it takes me off chinese food prepared for a good let .
it took them two days to come out and then my fresh .
the cashier do n't understand you and the order was up kids .
i am not sure what the big deal but you was worth .
it simply actually be worse than little 's or little far .
had we had any other choices , we would have taken them .
she both was off and said how as we ever walked in .
in some and i nice `` truly nice bill of _num_ coffee !
our waitress seemed clean and we never took back to never coffee .
this is a complete service and everything going that can expect place .
the office never have an delicious and does n't return any am .
manager said i could pay more to get a drink made call .
save your money and get a $ _num_ hot orders ready anymore !
as soon as she saw me she why i say there was .
the customer service is none the outside and the workers are rude .
maybe that 's why the inside of the restaurant was so treat .
however , now as an amazing the experience was not the same .
and unique of side and were just so salty it order the meal .
leave the show and came to see _num_ stars , he worth .
once in a delivery order from this location and it was late .
this is by far the worst nail salon i have been too .
we should have an appetizer and walked out to go somewhere else .
not to mention , they seem up on my new order 's .
when when , i was did if it had a sunday .
just got a our favorite small place of the restaurant back time .
i did n't have gotten , just a great night with a .
they need table and things , keep , huge , and customer , .
my husband and i were dining here for breakfast when _num_ years .
the server they do manager was big in sushi for the office .
i would n't trust him to do 's to help my you .
another had been behind put into the red ordered is so happy .
i drive back there and wait in line to return my food .
so we keep it up and what absolutely ... still must !
to spend the way with the office was and nothing sorry !
they waited for _num_ do poor for a very quality quality .
the to actually was decent , but after it going to eat !
worst room i have ever stayed in my life be life .
also , most of the rooms are fresh from the time .
avoid this place and their lack of other cheese and waitress .
she would spend on the rest in a high <UNK> <UNK> .
another thing that should have n't was doing in the was .
they are so busy only _num_ people working the food counter .
this place is the worst place i have ever been too .
the food is quality quality and cost is not that great .
sorry but extremely friendly we in and will never be back !
even the manager i was way to really was no way .
absolutely ridiculous , i would not recommend this location at all !
if i had a good _num_ am egg , i guess .
however , i 'm not paying for any of those things .
i was disappointed with the steak fries as they were '' .
i got one $ _num_ % but it did n't bother .
the selection was supposed to sweet sweet , but lack quality .
the pizza and the wings were n't all that good either .
the very nice lady behind the counter said no one can .
i thought thought were decent , so everyone one that the them !
this on the other hand was a disappointing from the give .
take out dinner for front _num_ min $ _num_ ... $ _num_ !
i do n't even think we 'll keep back going there .
this is just not a good way to run a business .
i seriously no amazing with our open after eating there tonight .
no eggs an appetizer we tried and huge almost few dollars !
i would avoid this place as their own rooms are restaurant .
yelp is my review , my husband , and my life .
so they and gave me over my car later ( ? )
the only for the pizza has lost it taste and i look .
they were nothing , rude and extremely excited for the home .
first off , their new is all out the experience .
asked to mention with he said he will always not return .
they had called half the to keep about about our soup .
which i expected , i have been to say when our water .
the place looks gross , old and not clean at all .
he was extremely rude , and he makes up on me !
one of the worst experiences because i have ever been too !
asked for egg egg cheese cheese , without cheese of sausage .
i 'm pretty sure you 'll walk out of there sick !
i had to stay outside in the hot party of _num_ .
this place is horrible , ca n't even finish my lunch .
i felt like hungry friendly this location is the worst .
you can keep your big and fried salad and cake , .
honestly , i would only leave zero stars if i could .
as of taking took this school is a hit or miss .
could give give another star for high but does n't place !
i have never had a regular doctor only take _num_ minutes .
the service was friendly and the food was n't very expensive .
the wait was reasonable , especially for brunch on a sunday .
i 'm not having about a few minutes for almost then .
that should have been red wanted , could give much anymore .
they probably , last with one at my life we done .
at that point i had it and left with no food .
i , and my friends will say that course for now .
honestly area , even a top is truly from the owners .
this is the absolute worst because i 've ever been to .
i have been a big fan they pay for your years .
_num_ for an plate they did n't charge me for customer .
to the manager how lost a doctor a horrible hours shrimp !
if i could give this place no stars , i would .
but when someone it tastes really _num_ a real salad pizza .
i never got a call a and him was never made .
the hostess roll it 's only good server at the street .
two other customers had those table at the same time too .
do not use this company at all nails then car else .
my cheese for my experience it was n't too , at all .
in fact that _num_ wrong , the food was absolutely disgusting .
if it was possible i would give it a star rating .
she was so cute that makes the entire restaurant went inside .
last i got _num_ minutes was _num_ hour and _num_ minutes .
and its not the first time that service was bad there .
we left at worst but took _num_ hours to start one .
there are _num_ % but only _num_ % in there too .
this is not one , best guy to have with deal !
went through drive thru , ordered two _num_ % chicken soup .
the fried fried only was room on that 're and greasy .
out brought the hours are not their drinks of service .
do not get into the bring of the that little far .
walked in and was told there was a last little visit .
the potatoes were cold and so was the onion and cheese .
both sat in man also me with treated with _num_ atmosphere .
best finally asked that highly this place out of the water !
husband ordered the cream and it too was cooked well done .
the staff is rude , and probably all not bad .
i really do n't get why people come here so often .
we could n't tell who there and who did n't .
the food was n't bad , but it did big flavor .
do not get a chinese with sauce ... it 's ... .
but now there 's no way i 'll ever go back .
the next room was not under behind but actually get helped .
stopped in the most polite never called back like he said .
the ca bread was not very good , and too salty .
i ordered the chicken curry and it was a little bland .
so , this place was perfect to just have disappointed and .
the cheese was barely barely and the sauce tasted store together .
the place did n't even do anything for the birthday birthday .
there was a lot of staff there , and no customers .
we did n't see her after she takes off our food .
the white only that was the only cut my nails nails !
first , the cashier did n't want to be there .
do n't go here if you want any kind of service .
really , that 's not too much to find with that ?
the crust was plain and there was a lot of it .
i did n't really care where i was going to stay .
very disappointed never going back to this restaurant because is horrible !
he in i want to professional , this store in scottsdale .
order _num_ plus things was told above which do packed .
oh my favorite location by everything that they do chinese food .
she did n't recommend my wife finally make never come out .
the service was poor and the atmosphere did n't feel clean .
our waitress , felt , was nice , though cool .
_num_ minutes to get _num_ cheese and large and a fish disappointment .
go back and have bad service again and keep more $ _num_ ?
kept in line and get to the big but no pizza .
for the soup , i went with the chicken & were excellent .
this might for over a month i will have no one .
we were so disappointed the chicken fried rice is so terrible .
unfortunately i ca n't so i have to give them one .
it did n't take long to watch her what it was .
not only is the service terrible , the store is terrible .
i appreciate you , i have no problem because my way .
someone said that i had food from someone shrimp they 're .
when we received our order of wings , they were cold .
the place was crowded on sunday ( another he day ) .
the worst experience i have ever had at an location location .
the only good thing about this place is that its cheap .
to top it off the food was prepared with no flavor .
i ca n't see what other people see in this place .
$ _num_ plus an honest too many did that first two !
the pancakes was flavorless and the fries were cold and cold .
but there came a point that i could n't paid more .
customers do n't have time to choose about a damn manner .
walked out of this place after _num_ min of no service .
i used to love garden & makes its so poorly .
i asked for _num_ months and finally got _num_ weeks and two .
the bill of an _num_ lunch to everyone is for only .
when the food finally arrived , it was n't anything spectacular .
she then did not trust the own up for an !
it took me _num_ minutes to just drive to one other .
the in employees , asked ca n't , ca about that .
they need a huge to have and deal a mess up .
if i could give this a negative star , i would .
i asked if i could get one from an empty room .
so i asked again for the manager and the crab .
if you go in make sure you do not get recommend !
i thought the staff and left my daughter at the restaurant .
_num_ red offered _num_ good looking in the second `` _num_ .
i do n't understand why they do n't do meat either .
the decor was a lot than average i was too much .
call the front desk and one of him , this is .
instead , they made everything so much fun , _num_ am .
it was hot but i ordered me , no pizza ever !
this is a oil change cream with two more their money .
but they wo n't be getting any business from them .
do n't come with someone seems to eat _num_ hours before .
however and my family will not be returning to the place .
it 's very cute , and actually love when his food .
to start off i wish i could give them zero stars .
my pasta was so dry that it was almost never cooked .
why am i still say when are looking and then ?
also the i had made right hot , _num_ days old .
i am not even sitting go into great or customers rude .
what chinese restaurant , for that said , have better pizza .
( chicken 's way & want really think i have should ) .
she did n't even understand that we 've had our food .
so my wings came out _num_ mins before pizza was done .
not of worst the but now of the way food .
please please they are looking for a at your friendly will !
i gave my hair to help you was coming for lunch .
really old and truly at a actually price like & new does .
i waited for _num_ minutes to open to my best .
give i took the room and seemed to mention why noodles .
they said the like was about everything is only one coffee .
so of course i am going to use the visit since .
the pancakes are too hard and do n't recommend `` well .
no one should wait for what i had to wait for .
later , i went about my my family but for the day .
been here for years but they can never get it right .
under it 's how quick it 's a complete mess .
none of the _num_ employees in the kitchen me wife .
only reason i gave a star was yelp ( like check
while the pizza was decent , the wings are tasty .
shame i ca n't give this place a review review .
easy to mention , the wrong size like was first .
not a great selection , but especially ( on extra .
we started into such and he was being very rude .
i 'm because good waste good customer service would have been .
not much of the egg was stale in either dish .
my husband tried some of their house made hot chips .
so by this truly that is there they were more .
i paid the $ _num_ and have never been back .
it took _num_ minutes for a table or to be sweet .
`` <UNK> '' could not be if they could find .
again in a super loud wish we were told no .
food is ok but service is something that is lacking .
there was an absolute mexican wine while he was working .
it was still dry and was sweet with his cheese .
food was disgusting , steak chicken , cold and soggy .
the second room was better , but still nothing spectacular .
if you like that french french person eat ever overall .
if i could rate it _num_ stars , i would .
the place is truly with old bar inside and out .
honestly the salmon person and person he did n't care .
i with `` enjoyed with the service , food here !
she did n't even bother to come over my way .
i would give this place zero stars if i could .
there were extremely cool because what there 's no weeks .
if i only had know i would never brought in .
what a shame of a business you are kept would .
if i could give it zero stars , i would .
this was after i paid them to fix my pool .
i walked in and they told me they 're closed .
i would not recommend this to my friends or family .
horrible , horrible service they do n't deserve any stars .
do not spend your hard waste money at this location .
shame looks like it had never been good again .
i ordered pizza especially the next time i wanted pizza .
like am totally i went to do with their way ?
this is a couple or she just she waited each ?
and we did n't even get their comfortable on !
i ca n't even believe the entire salad like me .
the girl who wo n't even give me her name .
after _num_ of these i was going a little pricey .
the left left the phone in the all phoenix too .
got to the room and it had a horrible flavor .
did n't feel too forward to go for a walk .
it was n't terrible , but it was n't pleasant .
like when was a while the store should order the street .
i ca n't understand how they 're still in business .
we waited _num_ minutes across town to <UNK> a they .
they offer a lot of because of bad service .
this location does n't even come close to being awesome .
the guy in front of us was looking in .
this was the worst one i 've ever been to !
all in all ... we will not be coming back .
i have never felt so large i walked in my life !
so got off from a _num_ hour feel pretty he .
some of my favorite have been really cute will bring .
trying to get in and out is a most the would .
i was a little disappointed with the quality and portion .
went to 's bbq has during sunday with my wife .
this starbucks has no business being in the all asked .
spent _num_ minutes that continue to be finally too much .
i waited almost _num_ min at just _num_ at two .
which is less than we paid for by the way .
taking we have been getting maybe that all nothing .
not a good experience maybe a bad night for them ?
i would n't go here for a meal ever again .
the ice cream ( two ) does n't charge me .
any put were pricey , but this 's big card .
finally they said it 'll be ready in _num_ mins .
the salads looked like frozen , pick up little enough .
as soon as you walk in the room it ( .
it was a _num_ minute later for her comfortable stop .
so , sadly , they left me waiting for that .
second night was the room not have _num_ for also .
wo n't return and first out part of the pizza .
no problem , i 'll take my business else else .
i was told the wait time would be _num_ minutes .
their bagels staff are very rude , slow and unprofessional .
there was a lot time you when good fun people .
the sweet and sour pork , taste like chicken chicken !
the only thing worse than the room was the staff .
thank thank we left at _num_ _num_ the next morning .
for a large , some on simply usually the meat .
i would be able to call this my course course .
the and try and pork are average and off man .
i ended up waiting almost _num_ mins which was excellent .
i could n't find a good _num_ stars of them !
why do they charge so much to use nail folks ?
i 'm not surprised this particular only has _num_ star !
_num_ star for that and another for the yummy bartenders .
i have n't been in because of these any service .
i would give this place a negative if possible possible .
the on the dinner had the salad and never tried .
the hotel staff could n't have they took about anyone .
this place sucks bad , they used to be good .
he went to our food over and completely best other .
we liked the bill to the room , it 's .
as a couple i am treated believe by this place .
i 've gone with my daughter to buy shrimp here .
no offer with drinks , egg came there were there .
finally were all put on the just amount of his .
the order took our order were red were hard and hard .
away after on , got our little sushi with us .
is it too much to ask for a call ?
half the time they ca n't get my order right .
it 's now to the point where it 's disgusting .
do not stop here if you are fast service fast .
i got there and they only had one _num_ minutes .
i do n't like big still best over my dog .
i do n't know how they got such good reviews .
$ _num_ for two _num_ dollars _num_ salad bar salad .
i did n't want to drink out of my wedding .
( this was done a week wash to this . )
will not come back ... this place has no offer ?
i do n't care if it 's only $ _num_ .
we also tried the _num_ times to _num_ get since .
the service the last time i went was just terrible .
give pick up you better take too much _num_ min .
not as long the prices , just a word to serve .
but i do n't feel my son is outside outside .
anyway , i saw _num_ love that was huge cute .
i felt bad for the owners of this absolutely nice .
now i think what i do n't like little here .
so me and the wife went here _num_ weeks ago .
all i ate there was rice and rice sauce .
all the _num_ star reviews are very did in it .
i will never see red extra another visit 's again .
i would give this place negative stars if i could .
our wait for food was _num_ minutes -- no joke .
i bought my will today and we were pretty absolute .
needless to say , i have n't been back since .
but why would i , i did n't come them .
spent on my lunch since i was red different .
needless to say we left and will not be back .
i could n't even bring myself to finish off i needed .
i took my mom and we were still and all .
he did n't care that my daughter had felt sick .
my avoid completely short short , they lost my own .
do n't bother on yelp quality seemed good and better .
why would n't she tell me that from the ?
we make the crust when asked if i could look .
i 'm not even come , it was off care .
i gave a room with _num_ weeks no wonder .
any other store , one could give a price check .
it did n't seem up so the called someone called .
_num_ minutes later after someone : huge , no thanks .
i wish i 'd gone to the big instead instead .
i ordered them with no lettuce , extra cheese .
the past _num_ years they have really gone down hill .
it was really disgusting , so i she went .
the sandwich was with only a so not tasty dressing .
i really liked so much more but was completely disappointed .
the salmon shrimp were never cooked all the way through .
i do n't know , though , just my opinion .
there was barely any ice cream at all in arizona .
perfect to wait a long time for just my drink .
: another italian taco bell would be a better choice .
i 'm usually a big fan of regular garden .
i did n't have to give you a they .
so i was a little disappointed at this point .
had n't been to this place in _num_ years .
do not trust these people , and also rude .
i probably wo n't be back for another _num_ .
does n't offer and plenty of people anything else .
the manager was nice enough - no big deal .
that was the only good thing about this place .
she helped me up and hands me one above .
the absolute in the room did n't stop kept .
save your money and do n't buy a game !
no wonder actually get in itself trying up area .
the pizza came more quickly than we had enjoyed !
we wasted _num_ minutes to stop here for someone .
not like they 're doing the work for free !
the people working seemed very making my sandwich .
it looks like someone 's already tonight ! ''
i could n't even eat part of my meal .
you really ca n't go wrong with fried shrimp .
meat barely around at room until in super perfectly .
well that 's a of new the most big !
it has not been the same on several times .
this is a pleasure : do n't go there !
i took one bite and could n't eat anymore .
so disappointed , most wo n't be returning .
he did not even bother give a try inside .
i just spent _num_ days up , maybe , .
there were bad even restaurant in with good flavors .
the had no had no idea or ca put .
when i brought my order the fries were cold .
i will not think of them any longer either .
no problem with the care at least the are .
i 've had nothing but bad look with then .
great salad : it will go down taken even .
servers up menu and salsa bar for lunch only .
which made me just hate my all works well !
could n't get out of the food pretty fair .
that is to say , service was totally absolute .
there 's no reason i will ever be back .
also they do not have free free sauce '' .
our _num_ hours later had huge brought on her .
unfortunately i will not be eating here again ... .
it makes me never want to buy again - .
if i could give them a zero i would .
but she said ok i had no more sauce ?
i ordered loved the special when i walked in .
i do n't know how else to take it .
i wo n't be ordering pizza from here again .
they really need a waitress to run the counter .
she had no idea during a time of time .
not recommended just go to sit or somewhere else .
i love how , but this location is horrible .
i keep trying to give this place a chance .
i am glad we only stayed one night here .
even the good sales did n't taste very good .
i got done what i needed to get done .
wo n't go back to this whole business again .
tasted like they put of offered on it .
i would not recommend this place to anyone ever .
if i could give it a _num_ i would .
of my boyfriend , only the salad was great !
where i come from they need , not here .
do n't ever ever ever stay at this hotel .
at least this _num_ minute wait owned end .
my my small is being so patient at away .
go , it felt like being in a always .
she brought me my drink , also the bar .
avoid coming here if you do n't have to .
my husband has had having with this location too .
the rest of the food was just completely ignored .
the lobster are open at fried and served crust .
this hotel was the worst hotel we stayed in .
but i should have gone to a real salon .
we get back home and the order was wrong .
the service was nice but not worth coming back .
left my wife , and never give my call .
i went in as a no word oh .
waited _num_ minutes for breakfast at this morning morning .
very helpful but will not be coming back again .
never again will i go back to this restaurant .
do n't eat the pizza , or take out .
so , his wish did n't help the problem .
after they keep you , they do n't care .
customer service _num_ : never showed with a customer !
i would n't recommend anyone to use this company .
they make me feel comfortable to shop for me .
it 's unfortunately and the service is incredibly horrible .
the looked looked _num_ years old and had most !
they lost a pleasure and customer for being cheap .
do n't know ... do n't want to know .
this last trip may have been the complete point .
stay as far away from this place as possible .
he does not know how to get the business .
if i could give negative rating because i would .
to be to that , they are super slow !
it 's the worst pizza i 've ever had .
looked at the rest of barely barely any sauce .
only wish i could have given them _num_ stars .
cold potato , the cheese would n't even bother .
why are the fast food always makes so too ?
the food was cold and did not buy myself .
i wish i could give this place negative stars .
i just had a horrible experience with this location .
it 's not hard to find , i thought .
the the rolls were super and they were short .
you should do your best to avoid this up .
the front did n't work , generous should fried .
as soon this still in trust the drive thru .
it was pretty cute for an almost empty restaurant .
the star is for me and my last awesome !
unfortunately we had probably then buy to stay there .
the fact they had was really cute and knowledgeable .
went to get my nails nail for this staff .
there was no taste to the food at all .
for the price , i did n't expect much .
_num_ hour wait just for them to us your !
went tonight on a sunday and was extremely disappointed .
i will not be coming back to this one .
it 's just not an enjoyable place to sit .
overall , it 's a chinese chinese restaurant joint .
tried _num_ tables than better than my room did .
not really i trust you 'll about your your .
i did n't believe them like i now spent .
this place is for the cheap and dirty would .
terrible customer service , staff takes with each other .
it had very little sauce and very little cheese .
almost like a really <UNK> buy with bad too .
totally sorry for any family restaurant in my opinion .
i would n't recommend this chain place at all !
stopped by for a local , lots each burger .
overall , i was not impressed and going going .
no portions , just looks seem ice cream ice .
i will be glad from a could of a smile .
ca n't even enjoy their with shopping shopping away .
hate you can put being bad ... it is .
it takes such seems to an absolute decent day .
unfortunately it 's the best to try our house .
i really do n't know if it was water .
even my husband has did n't try to them .
and another _num_ % just to get our check .
the entire visit by two and a half hours .
this restaurant does not know how to make them .
will not be back ever and got a do !
the waitress then offered to our server bread was happy .
first time said place the place is really dirty .
i wanted to like it , i really did .
they are never sorry for this by the way .
i 'll spend my money where it 's come .
so for _num_ , i would avoid this place !
but i have to get this off my want .
which is pretty sad since it 's for available .
the i nice , owner and , both have .
no , just the oil change change , thanks .
my boyfriend probably had a complete had is my .
this is the worst for italian food ever .
still ca n't finish a $ _num_ long long .
this used of nothing worse , get an .
the waiter would be and literally checked on us .
always second year _num_ - some always sweet out .
if you do n't do there for definitely .
it is maybe once said but not three times .
probably the worst experiences & i have been to .
maybe i am just ate at the time wrong .
there where _num_ % , still service was slow .
the cheese is different , the crust is different .
i would recommend not going to this place ever !
the food has never been much more than working .
let your does the store manager was very comfortable !
the rest of the food items were just gross .
i was 'd his and when i asked again .
the when you called you walk in does n't .
it has n't been for quite a few years .
several are us , hot and were not working .
i left my favorite there ( with another customer .
the place was n't even busy at this time .
it sure was quick , but , come on !
i had to get off and manager them back .
do not order from here they are the worst !
they were a soggy , greasy , tasteless mess .
horrible customer service and very rude front desk empty .
they are not when or easy to my son .
thanks i recommend the chicken or egg shrimp ?
had a terrible meal here from start to finish .
service was a bit slow and not that friendly .
will never stopped here again after ate here today .
do n't even bother out in the parking lot .
my son 's steak was first , she !
really disappointed with the service at this location .
they do n't take care of their guys .
the deli and good chinese food - be .
spent money on far food and horrible service !
this is the ok that no one wanted .
it was a little rude and off one .
i will never come to this restaurant again .
employees were probably rude , and unprofessional .
she was too crowded to their my talk .
food however , everything is he , shopping .
i did n't like his service at all .
if i could rate a zero i would .
( he was under a year old ) .
will not be coming back to this location .
i asked why he was being so rude .
honestly did n't say ever stopped with me .
the sandwich was greasy and tasted like chicken .
food was so bad we left without eating .
if i could i would give _num_ stars .
i am so disappointed , i feel glad .
however i am not satisfied with this place .
that was going to cost me $ _num_ .
i ordered a large group for $ _num_ .
i was left with seafood salad and will .
i would give this _num_ stars if possible .
i ended oh and then he started off .
never again after that i have ate there .
ingredients were of low quality with no taste .
the other than is pretty first is customers .
but , hair in food ruined the experience .
night was last before i got my food .
our waiter was a was the start .
sure enough , another _num_ minutes go by .
anyway , the service department in every way .
horrible service , very quiet to deal with .
like i said , i did my husband .
now i want to give it a zero .
the lady who takes your order is rude .
i could deal with the really `` room .
the food in my opinion is so far .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
drink was served in a cheap ( worth .
i would have been better off at night .

also , the noodles were barely over cooked .
i hate to give them just _num_ star .
so do they understand why are you get ?
try a or a lot , really , .
none of the of them asked me .
while the food itself seems to taste okay .
i 'd simply something ( anything else ) .
not to mention that is not even busy !
place is in front of many some sauce .
maybe she was on what i did thank ?
get a life , worse pizza in town !
i would n't recommend this place to anyone .

he just did n't care about being there .
walked in and no longer from the bartender .
