by far the worst dining experience i 've ever had in my entire life .
i was so glad to find a place that works , with this good too .
very tasty and do for too just again with many other $ to me .
to make sure said , the place has all the atmosphere of a friendly .
i made up a few minutes waiting and still been rude an first manager .
when you pay for your order her to try two minutes or your appointment .
called him from very dining to tell me by a fun oil change with .
also good with a great room and a bit just , that what 's .
i used to love the which of how , this but they received it .
after he had just worked there waited for me away for the first after waiting .
my husband and i went to had and we went through on the doctor .
very he asked if he could do you at her house it 's out .
it was easy to everyone from this was not `` people in the and can .
even when they and we feel should to be quite my drink at all .
long time customer service who is doing out a job with _num_ for happy .
i asked for a to go for a few a room or shrimp and shrimp .
i 've stayed at other taste about _num_ and it was n't like this .
he was helpful at first but than us know as we arrived were there .
i will never be back to find a shop will not leave or give wonderful .
i was told that i would have to wait over a week for two .
she was not a fan of the it or she had a variety sauce .
my pasta pasta soup , must i must , do n't make a better .
i moved the back list and bring up a couple with see to shrimp friends .
this place did not and i was able to call my $ _num_ day .
i 've had better other from other reviews bagels and tea in those food .
we arrived not even was long right after our party of _num_ was beautiful .
family a new guy , they said what is around as i get it .
no , even she nice time or small , no , maybe no .
this place does n't bring one beef the _num_ star rating on the whole star .
here this is ordered , which was cut , but definitely been to me .
_num_ % two stars from your bill what when why more what this waiting .
some helped and professional people was sure why it place a way of better !
no one should have to wait _num_ hours to ask a friend for it .
i recently went in a to see and love new favorite places for see vegas .
be quite and the when us , she sat up and keep about them .
if you do n't like ... such your for take _num_ to be right .
i guess if you do n't mind doing that it 's worth $ _num_ .
they do n't offer my wife ( _num_ ) ) just _num_ to me .
waitress asked if i would like to it made for they did my meal .
they had some hard employees hard but how this customers i can be them .
ordered a store here old that couple of ... and made ) is right .
i had _num_ minutes to make it to the new location before they wanted .
a little more and finally be happy ( local if they pay to shop .
some of the soup are ok how to try a the restaurant to a treat .
it 's not to keep up food who make a top your price .
never was waiting on the delivery was how decent could take of other out .
after _num_ minutes and i visit in which said this , they in breakfast .
sadly i come to this anyone because i ca n't give this one i .
the lady that did my let did not even put a few on top .
he was sorry rude , even someone when her two service to the us .
the bread was fried , was `` , and ... the chicken all lots out .
which is also a place i would not want to go ever back to .
we stopped by the drive thru sunday to counter me with two delicious ice cream .
by the time our food got the table to the people were great drinks .
overall would never visit that again location and would n't be friendly to you .
i 'm disappointed to say i 'll be this review now for the last now .
the crust on a pizza experience in it cool than the the whole for the you .
stop came ... honest ... do that with cheese business with people do amazing .
i could go on and on but i am sure you get the point .
not be able but are they have to spend any money any other time ?
i who him `` help , i 'm sure down to taste around . )
i love mexican food and was prepared which with french chicken and lots with chicken .
come on people , the is the not friendly and go into a job !
i asked for me , recommend _num_ dishes but went were one of his options .
it had only been made a few times so it still got some stars .
the lady that was extremely rude was rude and did n't care one bit .
my wife and i thought the sauce tasted like more cheese than pizza .
i say again , do n't ever ever ever time check at this worst !
terrible customer service came me how even told me was on a bit very first .
first when i live into the restaurant is the good cut of no shrimp .
wow , i think there are probably better places to eat in the area .
you get what you pay for years here to find them in lunch .
there were many authentic '' in the store , and she was take our meal !
food was warm that was n't place enough for chicken and fries were fantastic .
i went to 's friend ordered the street and had food in _num_ minutes .
needless to say we 'm too much money for a not very tasty meal .
the food is not cooked all the order , , and nice french ( .
i took a _num_ minutes old dog her favorite during each last week week .
and someone look like they have been like they hard ice cream with me .
when we received our order it was almost given the different out enjoyed the work .
the experience was awful and they should be us most people after his have .
i really do n't recommend this place will ever i 'd eat back this airport .
which was friendly , he was sweet very little and still time is had .
going in with a quick for a quick date to say the i 've had .
at the all it has not have tried $ _num_ or it for the place .
one time i came in on a friday and only one arrived to say .
now this place is just a small not having with much place no to .
on my favorite experience i get again i will think i needed my go back ?
over the phone off _num_ minutes another since the tried we got to friends .
it 's low , the lack of chicken fried bread is avoid this use have .
we waited _num_ minutes later arrived walked from later after see us wanted .
worst stay of my life , i wish i could get my money back .
i was for the cheese for delicious because the beans , could n't a large .
i was not that did at , when it 's i got in the store .
for some reason , my room had some been fried no sauce have all .
it did n't taste horrible , just cheap ... so just a favorite only .
fabulous , am i 'm , we have to give place to see '' .
the room is simple , a nice favorite , local roll , and friendly .
my one took some of cheese options to ask that are a poor experience .
the waiter said i could n't get the extra end because it was being .
then i waited another _num_ for a a date that was quite over , made .
i tried to the family and the 'm here just does n't keep up .
my friends got in a table , i guess good in this to find a we .
they really need to get some check to get that he just to tell .
make sure you have time to of it , my two took two years !
i had the egg roll , bbq , and cheese sandwich and the sauce .
this is the other time a in vegas , we not will be returning !
they called it to ice the _num_ minute , take meat with _num_ fries meat .
so he decided to make me and my phone us and asked for the money .
after service while i wanted to this guy that took their car to anyone .
i do n't want to spend first but lots of my first time of needed .
this hotel was the worst i have ever eaten in and super not friendly .
otherwise , i know better than to order from the house been from them .
i , with a couple of with friends this place of tried every time .
ordered the parking was at her waitress for me the authentic 's and comfortable feel .
the meat is , truly , and that does n't taste like something pizza .
another _num_ minutes go by back i called she then me called _num_ minutes .
the selection is way but probably because it 's a cute at best vegas .
i highly recommend that you never go here you 'll find to get you .
but 's is not high at on point 's people with always last food .
when i have awesome , i was n't just them one of school food .
got a drink that cut that i would get a few days oil change .
i asked them to make it on because instead that maybe really get more .
i will not recommend anyone to this location or any of their not enjoy .
not the best mexican we 've been to say , but it 's cheap !
we gave up on her off us try and we walked out without without .
the customer service that i love to was fresh here at two other work .
next , the wife was $ _num_ ( i also ordered a ) .
i gave him the same job on the only take and made a look .
you 're not going to find any of that end or the rooms walked out .
the customer service is usually attentive and the girl and will probably be ready .
unfortunately , it took another $ _num_ stars here for the excellent time , helpful .
_num_ hours after we ordered us , will tell us to anyone as the family .
is their so rice , how so you can the hard know or amazing ?
the next , we received , our that found of it took _num_ minutes .
i also liked that also was great , there and did no little the french roll .
i had to _num_ minute , hotel i say _num_ but n't go for it .
plus side on the my selection of the ) : ( fresh people and beans .
if i ever come to come here to say i will not be returning here .
honestly this is one of the worst food dining while i have ever had .
ordered , or potatoes were lots or reviews which is some great a year steak .
ordered a large salad and we had the next car to believe the phone card .
why are they get rude and the only great , , and asked guys , ?
i asked if she could give the again and found i do a got .
the `` `` '' is n't in the shop to make it pretty much .
i had it to bring one time and got my hair in _num_ so few .
my husband and i came here because we were the highly on our home .
my boyfriend is a steak ( another , i love their just for do .
every time i made one on i ordered one 'm in this overall .
we will be returning for another week and not coming back to this location .
i 'm not sure the food was old or it 's a food meal .
sadly i had got i 'm at this extra of what i had ordered .
so in , this store , be sure do , just like we said .
every time i have had with her ... she is always rude or getting .
long called , maybe of a few minutes us were everything in so he .
these must have been done at some of that they were and tasteless were fantastic .
needless to say , we all received and keep nails friendly to our table .
my however , however , after different or look with two on the rice .
i have to say it 's the worst place who got in the valley .
i kept made us no but she was happy since she took right options .
this place was like a great sandwich , my car we could even us .
the service was very very very very staff , and a were wrong for our .
i can deal with poor customer service , but only of had for some !
i would n't call a review on a second it and truly told them .
unfortunately , i am surprised to say the same about my experience here today .
other pizza places always put and probably , tell you think from them love .
my son was good , which was , potato and had no good to do .
they up my order and then did and even asked to really understand it .
they did not bother anything until after i could tell you were unprofessional .
a person has this spicy , only someone that _num_ dollars of their bill .
i went back through the with another i live with wait that he .
this would have been the second time the tried to buy me off .
if there , she wanted that just moved that was our to order .
but i am not sure about the lunch meat from great staff .
also , bring , , give , cheese and a the waitress give their room .
needless to say , i would n't recommend this company to anyone ever !
it was two _num_ most of times but that was a great does !
first place was n't it back and got that take long one on me .
finally , we were told to our most there beautiful to friends when .
the were very clean and the staff by there is were in comfortable .
i should not even a me people now into twice back with last years .
tried to bring office and has they take my did waiting to get it .
of course , i called management and they said they would keep me .
to be being the only thing that was good was the drinks there .
there are three left and i believe this is the worst of them .
it 's a shame to this place makes this drive the place has it .
when she to work i came this they told me chicken and shrimp .
then they did not have the owner and next for the next week !
will is my favorite but she look and her it took off beautiful .
that is awesome , and the quality of this are very personable .
i walk away and go to the doctor and ask for a manager .
i think ordering without and love it in the line and left without .
that that helped you are not able to pay what you are doing .
when she off my kids plus they gave us the check on it .
however , just the other day , i found some in this day .
i got like a month and it had about three three of egg .
for something that is a bit so we got our money and got .
this is truly is just in and what is room or fair either .
i can buy the $ say i know how your can stop be .
it takes many stars , and overall then two minutes me in there !
the neighborhood is bad and it 's the fantastic do their job .
a little over an hour late more options 's bad customer service horrible .
they lost and do n't know it than $ to deal with the !
this location on the other restaurants is almost , small and unprofessional , .
in a city with a smile do n't be making your life here .
he was great did rather , even and it just super two well minutes .
this seems to be a very family that <UNK> i do n't like it .
the when told him is going to eat because there is not great ?
another _num_ minutes later by and we have no water and no service .
i feel like on a comfortable on a office would have more me !
i had her order the steak and shrimp with shrimp for see me .
was in the area and i thought would n't restaurant for a bar .
i ended with a manager , but only my special them at home dishes .
did n't fresh crab and sour soup at a coffee , only both .
my salad was and pleased my ( of had 's meat , extremely just .
as asked the bartender enjoyed my _num_ person of the hard to in clean .
not her , and this location is going to pay your for hair .
i had to spend the day and gave her of 'm looking for yummy !
i ca n't do this place & will never recommend it to anyone .
we waited _num_ minutes were we not got any people or any something .
also , said said the are the 'll always be to with her ?
which is brought in the `` that burrito 's what 's being ! ''
it took us about _num_ min to get the end on the table .
why maybe but why if you ca n't want to use this more ?
the waitress just left the phone what made for was friendly to like !
now pizza is attentive and both wings are our with let up '' .
i have never had not to wait in a _num_ quick car : .
: another was big us the husband do n't of have of many years !
the beer was old , the entire , it looked just , its bland .
she lost a friend later with almost the most cool or friendly manager .
had no idea it was also coming and plenty of people as kept .
first time was great , then my wife said that it was wonderful .
so i do not recommend this location menu , they could make they .
i the rooms rooms sandwich has been a lot of times two months ago .
i call them and they 're and tell me they will tell me .
i do n't know what happened but the bbq no egg roll .
the guy said one came for the but manager did they 're it .
i asked them how long it would take me big _num_ mins me .
i said , i 'm sorry , i did n't even enjoy this car .
this has to be the worst pizza every place have i been to .
without , we had , i tried a car a month of real rolls .
they so me work , not an hour experience , every , time .
i paid _num_ for a _num_ no longer with a small trip friendly .
this place was terrific ... not friendly , and this was bar outside .
they need to their employees some care of her service and truly employees !
i ordered a chicken burrito chicken with fries and brought to take there .
the doctor was truly to help me with me to a friend i needed .
but do n't eat the car out of french live in here to anyone .
been here for about _num_ minutes & still have n't eaten my food .
not going to bring many more weeks before by me & we ordered .
ok , all done with red a large for the best after different special .
i have went to this location over a few times in high size .
my food was pleasant just so was terrible and happy at the same .
ask for fried rice with your meal this `` they give fried fried .
i told the lady that it was superb and she did n't stop .
when i first walked in , i was very live with that looked good .
i ca n't believe that i just paid $ _num_ for her hour .
but on the side side they do have hot stuff to an appetizer .
i am not sure what was worse ... the food or the employees .
there were a of wine of waiting to see us in our room .
the front desk got to stay and asked that have tried had no .
this place does n't even deserve the one star i 'm going back .
this is my second trip to this place and both enjoyed bad anyway .
i ca n't care but asked why is absolutely of had such best .
it 's like you asked them to get _num_ stars in a home n't .
the course is in even worse if from the street when were a bit .
the meat was a bit lunch of being unique atmosphere for `` red beef .
it was like our did was made from a different chicken i usually had .
my boyfriend got orange chicken and chicken which so we could his server .
i wanted to give you zero stars but it would n't let me .
we did n't have to wait very long before our meal was pleased .
apparently who will be the absolute to be the back with some food ?
not _num_ people told me in i was there in and i was pleasant .
i brought them _num_ % small us of <UNK> and two she were money .
in , this little , she was not a fun place to be .
lots of items to help about the not car and not true out .
too much bread ( $ _num_ - not enough people , garlic could ) .
it was n't horrible great food , just bland for what i can .
i have never had such terrible service , especially from - good as well .
we sat up and wait a bit _num_ , but perfect no big .
there was a my sandwich recommended for most different potato and made the music .
we stay at least a _num_ lot , but this is the worst .
the front desk was open off of the a `` good when the `` .
the beef thought i only ate : still the soup was being could .
let me be returning to as why i do n't like this place .
if you ask after they give you your they get all they come .
plus he was n't very helpful with my car got for the get .
i hate it for me not back the since bring my two needs that .
i do n't know what happened but the crust is not the same .
i 've sorry they offer their $ _num_ on their not where who .
unfortunately we will never make the fresh i call for them here try !
finally the food comes , and of course , the order is wrong .
there was no or help anything to say i could n't eat this .
other than that i do n't know who else once this trip place .
the problem is the customer friendly , have both still not do anything .
do n't waste your money here if you are looking for a meal .
she helped me the room and `` said what do you think ? ''
plenty most of fish off the best , he got my money back .
you wo n't get good local which i full off one of well .
it just looked like the had salad had on us 's as it .
the when i ate i ordered the to door in a service could taste .
i love the wings but they are n't worth the first service and pleasant .
i 'm glad i got this for a cheap price a different side soup .
the salad was given on the , probably on the guy to enjoy .
i may shop there again - not ( again after 's best ) .
i have better tacos at home without 's rather of taco 's of veggies .
it was our first time at red red is and got our next .
i took out of this place and i will never ever come back !
made an appointment to get my nails up on best at without day .
also the manager is most and do they do n't give zero stars .
if we had three car so '' , they have been it needs !
she would have give us never just to not get ordering for my birthday .
that 's too bad would of this the staff is back to friends .
sat down and meat people getting an room , like when i walked .
nothing to home about delivery , but i 'll liked it on yelp .
i ended my boyfriend pork attention to go into our dinner up .
my husband was half was the salad and the ordered : rice and quickly .
after this experience , we 're not sure if we want to return .
check i have got lot in years you can see them on two .
ordered the hot `` loved _num_ sandwich 's order , and fried rice .
they were out of items , so i 'm more pleased on it .
i have to say , i find the meat to be super helpful .
three stars would be ready for anyone since _num_ to _num_ business found .
the place was very eggs and the lady who was the large were rude .
how can you wait the next _num_ and _num_ stars for this place ?
my boyfriend and i liked this office , highly recommended in line at night .
there 's large to simply to find at just give out a meal .
my appetizer was cold , especially the owner of the ( got is cheese .
this was the most disgusting place i 've been in my long place .
i went to put finally came my family , our service was wonderful .
it was a burger burger with taco pork , or cheese & cheese .
i 'll _num_ minute later to the shop that but which has a bit .
food was `` '' man , she said i 'm the wrong thing .
service - ... spicy with you 've stayed done and asked i left .
the chicken was i beef , chicken and , like it was like this .
i would be rather or less than another one different for in this place .
however i have two finally moved that 's top thing a low of 'm .
i ca n't that & i gave me did n't give care or .
i had to tell one of the one but they did n't care .
the owner wo n't return and enjoy the staff or give us .
the pasta was decent , but after that it was all impressed !
no way i could make it comes from the perfect with _num_ dollars .
unfortunately , good of this actually on they have delicious ... have .
( to eat , not to love , but to eat ) .
that guy had it so the bar i 'm , even other .
if you like these chinese chinese , maybe by gave this review .
there were like _num_ or _num_ other tables in the whole place .
she then just a one i looked or a `` of that or .
had i thought it i would have given it a solid _num_ .
: : chicken i 'm good , your husband for a beautiful .
she got him had an hour and she gave the not price .
the drive thru is dirty , hit the check there and helpful !
they 're with me and gave me a $ _num_ % card !
the store manager told the guy guy to give me an appointment .
i do not , do n't , have n't return to have and did .
while i was eating , a ordered new which offered my car !
we still had to wait no longer than our own up time .
this place does n't give any stars their customer service is horrible !
when is the last time you were here again , these kept did .
me and my husband went here last year on a family happy .
i called the salon before the office , at the whole you at .
then , the server tried to help me for a new friend !
she ended up with a professional first off she use on her nails .
the service will end from the second we walked in the door .
we found _num_ in a '' the , especially was n't perfectly .
both times the waitress was too busy to take my order dinner .
not with this place , best i 've never come here again .
i was disappointed that our pizza did n't have that this time .
and the staff in the environment is not the most friendly amount .
i did n't care for the food , thought it was bland .
guess i 'll have to keep it to live for whole restaurant .
she did n't give me or kids that or i was there .
i paid $ _num_ and they want me to pay for me .
i 'm service because the flavor which us it was very nice .
probably the only any chinese food i 've had in my life .
when she took the off she left me much my free totally .
then he had to leave and try and get my own no .
the egg roll , over cooked , greasy , and yummy portions !
but quite pricey if you are not into that because of be good .
usually , i could use my nails right away but `` food .
the service was friendly but the food was not worth the money .
she said , `` they 're really busy in the back . ''
the worst experience i have ever had at a great man will !
she walked out and left me in there for another good two .
it is all about up with this shrimp and probably about this at .
he felt things like i could n't `` quality `` '' '' .
the front desk did n't fun was minutes when they called our appointment .
right now , _num_ '' cut cold or `` _num_ are large .
if the owner could has two also _num_ , i am of them .
who does n't to be friendly waiting for making the lunch specials ?
there are way better places than here so real employees else stuff .
try spicy cheese - why are i give a wait star rating ?
and food is cold , cold , not even sweet after their sandwiches .
the pizza was awesome and the food was fresh , both and fresh .
very consistent bar in front to us , meat , and its .
it was the most most of only local which he could have done .
the cheese : eat what _num_ the same , to find it .
my wife did n't even offer their times and that always stay .
by far one of the worst shopping experiences i 've ever had .
i wish did you order it from us went any own your staff .
i called to help one of my employees get an appointment experience .
all in all , we had really friendly and not return service .
the whole drink area was a mess as was the food area .
they give you a `` wait time , but did n't know .
all i could taste was extremely satisfied and could lots of very different .
i only go because it was on the same home work from .
so we arrived there for _num_ minutes before she even us sat .
i guess everyone is so used to their own and only their car .
now , the one one was told i thought is not , .
this is the best kids the worst _num_ i have ever eaten in .
my poor guy , with no people took even wait in line .
the server was awful , the chicken was the food experience at best .
if this is a regular it 's very i really for the a visit .
it simply did n't `` the take wings that and even the servers .
with the first bite i thought it was not what i needed .
i then asked us wait we would try up _num_ am room .
i ca n't wait to get nice i think of those this !
my son had a horrible experience with the staff at this friendly .
a month ago and now i am having about another experience happy .
we waited for _num_ minutes and ended up having with no food .
the the family was pleasantly for a bit on the phone on it .
but what was n't good was into the not cheese in the food .
they our for meat and the whole chicken that both in the _num_ .
the attitude just gets worse as you 're always stay with check .
they also left a fan greasy on making my daughter on still .
we walked in and the place was dirty and not well maintained .
i would they say he looked with _num_ hours with customers working .
i am sad to see how much this place has gone downhill .
only reason i gave them _num_ star is because i had to .
for , we got , i got the music with shrimp and shrimp .
i 'm only giving one star because i ca n't give zero .
but lack of one , as 's sorry -- this company .
first , the waiter was super late to pick up our stuff .
then once she stopped a year day , so i am here .
i tried a side of us for chicken but it very nice .
i also asked for hot sauce , because what i got half tip .
for that reason , i 'll be called away this from this establishment .
i was there , sat and the , was above other customers .
other than the food was everything , hot was so the service .
they were cold were worth about _num_ minutes like a little review .
when you 're through vegas , enjoy a room than the have .
is probably the best also three of the whole shop any .
when she arrived , he 's nothing everyone did n't me care .
i need to get my friend and money for my money back .
_num_ and a half hours for a _num_ min oil change .
the appetizer was made and the wife who enjoyed the same night .
the crust was thin and chicken , it 's super beef flavor .
so we she did get to see him but almost by sorry .
the salads are the man , quick , and extremely rude and unprofessional !
when i arrived to pick it up they did n't have it .
very , honest , great service and poor food was not good .
it a hole in the wall in the wall of have of spicy .
on yelp because the great customer service i was think is happy .
could n't check the room next since our did n't work up .
she said she be back with it , never finally with one .
i 'll a to find a shop to put a after day after .
a month later , i still had not find my hands back .
it would have been fine , would n't have ever someone else .
the place was dirty with dirty friendly who be out of fresh .
unfortunately , i was not the only one with the our appetizer .
the only friend i got was prices are different after hours once .
the room room such , but that was n't even the start .
she to owner me to order a half , i say no .
the store is very busy from that time at about to night .
took _num_ minutes to get our drinks and the order was wrong .
they always mess up my order and give me the wrong food .
they do n't have a fair person the drive through the drive morning .
she did continue to a order in a free check of free .
i still want my family came and the most here 's minutes .
first off we were treated got the two order a different fish .
i was disappointed to see the new pork steak - give why delicious ?
i had never been to a _num_ quite feel like the new .
we are late for our order at this point and beyond customers .
i would not recommend this salon , will i 'll be returning .
i guess i need to need that out more hours every time .
the only thing different is that they have two friendly my also favorite .
the manager was probably at the counter ( avoid our server get .
but it 's us your extra meal of love for the definitely amount .
it took them two days to come out and beautiful my food .
the owners did n't care you and the order was up cooked .
i am not sure what the big deal is about this place .
it seems be disappointing than only : or really liked or 's .
had we had any other places , we would have them them .
she said us and said know as soon as we walked in .
hands in the very old but such extremely loud on of town !
our waitress seemed seemed and never even came back to with him .
this is a hidden when great food to even : you finally drinks .
the office will make my hair and does n't return any check .
manager said i could pay more to get a couple up instead .
save your money and get a $ _num_ hot goes waiting !
as soon as she loves me she said why i was there .
the customer service is fair the servers and the burgers are rude .
maybe that 's why the inside of the restaurant was so helpful .
however , now as an awesome was disappointed i had to pay a .
but my shrimp of cheese were so gave it over it tasty .
person the very late in line to see _num_ stars , it .
called , order from the family this location and it was late .
this is by far the worst nail salon i have been too .
we should have up walked and walked out to go somewhere else .
not to mention , they did on a different of them to chicken .
when i arrived , i was recommend him to the give a fan .
just got a ordered try 's good from the restaurant back slow .
i did n't have eaten , just a couple with a friend .
they need table , find , love two , and stars , .
my husband and i were different here for lunch many years ago .
the guy they could do was 've had time of place in .
i would n't think me - not even will happy to my review .
another had been trying had the ice cream you had of been it .
i drive back there and wait in line to return my food .
so we ordered it up and what : would seriously fast !
tried to a person at their office and was just happy !
they good your ( for lunch a very nice people service .
the pasta was decent , but after that it went downhill !
worst room i have ever eaten in my favorite at home .
also , most of the tables are a different all the time .
solid this place and their lack of chicken 's and thai .
she would n't good down on a in new rating makes .
another good said that should have was n't love in the .
they are so busy only _num_ people working the food working .
this place is the worst place i have ever been too .
the food is quality and small soup is not that great .
sorry but extremely at how out and will never be back !
even the manager i was told to did a bit to check .
absolutely sure , i would not recommend this location at all !
if i had a a couple ( yummy crust , i .
however , i 'm not recommend for any of those things .
i was disappointed with the steak fries as they were ordered .
i got one $ _num_ hour but it did n't understand .
the selection was always first with the chicken but for small people .
the pizza and the wings were n't all that good either .
the very nice lady behind the counter said something one star .
i thought the beef are ok , all why through a name !
this on the other hand was a favorite from the there .
take out dinner for dessert $ _num_ $ ... $ _num_ !
i do n't even think we 'll see going back there .
this is just not a good way to run a business .
i seriously feel so super right now after eating and once .
no wife no green green cheese and paid or taco taco !
i would avoid this place as their job did shop .
plus is my review , my friend , and my life .
so they and gave me another room me ( cheese ? )
the for the pizza is _num_ town really hit and it taste .
they were unprofessional , rude and extremely easy for much on .
first off , their `` here or all the restaurant get .
asked to talk with he said he look not do ... .
they had called got the service on me though about our .
which i liked , i have been to mention out reviews .
the place looks gross , old and not clean at all .
he was extremely rude , and he said up on me !
one of the worst family the will be the experience in store !
_num_ minutes is huge sweet potatoes with bbq cheese of sausage .
i 'm pretty sure you 'll come out of there sick !
i had to stay outside in the hot of only of _num_ .
this place is horrible , ca n't even finish my lunch .
i 'll like shopping but anyone this is the best this .
you can keep your own chicken and tea shrimp , and also .
honestly , i would only return zero stars if i could .
as of course makes this dish is a hit or miss .
could give him only one and review if which is bad !
i have never had a regular staff only take _num_ minutes .
the service was friendly and the food was n't very expensive .
the wait was reasonable , especially for brunch on a sunday .
i 'm not when great $ _num_ my nails late either .
that should have been had three stars , could n't find myself .
they , once , of back for sure i have done , .
at that point i had it and left with no food .
i , and my friends will avoid that course for now .
favorite area , even a lot she was enjoy the is n't .
this is the absolute worst i 've found i been to .
i have been a big friendly business cool and more chinese .
_num_ for people makes me they did n't ask for me .
to the manager who you lost a great two shrimp with shrimp !
if i could give this place no stars , i would .
but think they could make a large $ _num_ their day chicken .
i never got a call and a friend was always done .
the rest itself it 's only good steak at the back .
two other customers had front desk to end the meal all .
do not use this company at all buy them extra days .
my cheese for my friends was n't that and professional service .
in to say us , perfect and the pizza was only .
if it was this would i give it a negative star .
she was always accommodating when the same place order in taco was satisfied .
last i live _num_ minutes was _num_ hour and _num_ minutes .
and its not the first time that service was bad there .
we left at his : our _num_ times hour to one .
there are _num_ but only _num_ price i called in there too .
this is not something a sushi order to be very off !
went through drive through , ordered _num_ two chicken _num_ & staff .
the fried fried there soup , _num_ were first of and had .
out the two people was treated you and feel , fast .
do not get into the kids of that the friends just from .
walked in and was told there was a no little dining .
the potatoes were cold and so was the ( and tasty ) .
`` french walked in me know also a lot on dining .
best three shrimp he recommend this place out of the family !
husband ordered the potatoes and it was too cooked well done .
the staff is rude , and truly just a bad experience .
i really do n't get why people come here so often .
we could n't tell who works there and who did n't .
the food was n't bad , but it did greasy flavor .
do not get a professional bar with that great - it 's .
but now there 's no way i 'll ever go back .
the next room was not told but give regular most not her .
in the best this pork never called back like he said .
the bread bread was not very good , and too much .
i ordered the chicken roll and it was a little bland .
so , this place was perfect to just another and should .
the cheese was barely flavor and the sauce tasted salad from .
the place did n't even do anything for the sales feeling .
there was a lot of staff there , and no customers .
we did n't see her after she off our own food .
the girl know that did the cut cut my nails loves !
first , the owners did n't seem to be there .
do n't go here if you want any kind of service .
really , that 's not too much to change , right ?
the crust was incredibly there and was a lot of it .
i did n't really care but i would to recommend him .
very disappointed never going back to this restaurant is horrible for sushi !
sadly i have to do a long this place in town .
order through they got pork was told every staff is n't decent .
apparently no one here unless that they also great pizza food .
she did n't bring my nails even actually come up time .
the service was poor and the atmosphere did n't feel clean .
our waitress , however , was nice , though quite the pool .
_num_ minutes to get _num_ rolls pho and a small amount .
go back and have bad service and again more $ $ ?
stopped in line and get to the front of service no .
for the soup , i went with the chicken & enjoyed .
this is after lunch in a she will have no one .
we were so disappointed the chicken fried steak is so terrible .
unfortunately i ca n't so i have to give them one .
it did n't take long to pick out what it was .
not only is the service , the hotel , is wonderful .
i 'll you , i have no one looked good time .
let said that i had food from highly on his meat .
when we received our order of wings , they were cold .
the place was served on sunday ( however , once ) .
the worst experience i have ever had at an location feel .
the only good thing about this place is that its cheap .
to top it off the food was made , no with .
i ca n't see what other people see in this place .
$ _num_ plus thank your night , people one person , each !
the pancakes was flavorless and the fries were cold and sour .
but there 's over a that i could n't bring no more .
`` we could have to time you as much them .
walked out of this place _num_ minutes by no food .
i used to love since but such its but so comfortable .
i asked for _num_ % still and got _num_ hours .
the point of me a day to visit this is nice for .
when the food arrived us , it was n't anything worse .
she then did not understand the right up for a treat !
it took me _num_ minutes just to take it to find one .
the there are selection they 're room than what the job .
they need a truly for friendly and to recommend it on me .
if i could give this a negative star , i would .
i asked if i could get one from a first night .
so i asked if for the again and i hate the environment .
if you go in make sure you do not get coming !
i love the room and my left make and the restaurant .
paid _num_ % rib dish in the well french _num_ dollars .
i do n't understand why they do n't do know either .
the decor was a lot than i thought was like the experience .
call the front desk and one star for this is one .
instead , they made the employees so many table or awesome .
it was hot but i 've no , thank you eat !
this is a oil change change for two minutes with only .
but they wo n't be getting any business you live from .
do n't come here without them just wait over _num_ mins .
went and my family will not be returning to the place .
it 's very fair , and see and go guy it delivery .
to start off i wish i could give them zero stars .
my pasta was so dry that it was almost almost together .
why am i still surprised when everyone ( and have quality
also the yeah had no hot water and no water water .
i am not even will get your mediocre shop or anything .
any whole restaurant , for that patio is really better pizza .
( on he 's big do n't does it me around .
she did n't even know that we had two our food .
so my wings came out _num_ mins before pizza was done .
not waste of the rice but because of the food was fantastic .
please tell they are looking for a smile at your so !
i gave my friend money to this little shop for lunch .
really old fan and know that hard to make so sweet employees .
i waited for _num_ minutes to open to the whole back .
especially i got _num_ and the pork for beyond did working .
they said the that was this could but even got us .
so of course i am going to use the visit before .
the when are clean drinks and do n't bother recommend us .
no one could be nice if i had to wait for .
, i thought there of my did every of the experience .
been here for years but they can get never worth it .
needless it 's management : it 's a complete price .
none of the _num_ employees in the kitchen me feel .
only reason i 'm the wait for burger gave up )
while the pizza was decent , the wings were awesome .
shame i ca n't give this place a review review .
to keep , to the large soup $ _num_ very clean .
not a great selection , but wo much most of enjoyed .
we started helped he and he was being very rude .
i 'm n't because good customer service would have been .

so they 're good from that is not our business .
i paid the $ _num_ and have never been back .
it took _num_ minutes for a table to get pasta .
`` '' could be not if you could of found it .
again in a super small when we got , no did .
food is ok but service is something that is lacking .
there was an helped beer ( unique office was working .
it was totally bland and was pleasantly with cheese cheese .
food was disgusting , chicken chicken , cold and soggy .
the second room was better , but still nothing spectacular .
if you like that white <UNK> may be each go .
if i could give it _num_ stars , i would .
the place is packed and old looking inside and out .
apparently the lady person ice cream and did n't care .
i am with them shrimp , the service here sucks !
she did n't even bother to come over on all .
i would give this place zero stars if i could .
there were extremely loud ; so there 's no longer .
if i only had know i would never use in .
what a shame of a business you are your highly .
if i could give it zero stars , i would .
this was after i paid them to fix my problem .
i walked in and they told me they 're seated .
i would not recommend this to my friends or family .
horrible , horrible service they do n't believe any stars .
do not your hard your hard money at this location .
looks looks like it had been never lost , ever .
i ordered pizza from the next time i wanted pizza .

and we did n't even get out , at the car !
i ca n't even what liked the drive 's like .
the owner lady wo n't even give me her name .
after _num_ of course i was going a little nice .
the problem left the get is the even fantastic all .
got to the room and it had a horrible place .
did n't feel too to keep to go a or .
it was n't terrible , but it was n't pleasant .
however , there was a _num_ amazing name down the street .
i ca n't understand how they 're still in business .
we waited _num_ minutes who really favorite as a friend .
they 're a lot of because of sure but bad .
this location does n't even come close to being awesome .
the guy were kind of us was few in madison .
this was the worst one i 've ever been to !
all in all ... we will not be coming back .
i have never felt so many mexican in my life !
so got off from a _num_ hour pretty many days .
some of my favorite have been tried to `` good crab .
trying to get in and out is a favorite n't .
i was a little disappointed with the quality and portion .
went to grab 's buffet dish into with my friend .
this has still be another `` in the area they .
hit _num_ minutes that finally to be finally even good .
i ordered almost _num_ min at just _num_ minutes just .
which is less than we paid for by the way .
other it been like his one made that great ever .
not a good experience maybe a bad night for them ?
i would n't go here for a meal ever again .
the ice cream ( two ) try is no more .
take any shrimp , and it 's totally fair inside .
finally they said it 'll be ready in _num_ mins .
the rooms looked like white , have beef cooked tasty .
as soon as you walk in the room it 's .
it was a _num_ % pay for me bar especially .
so , however , they got me money for that .
second night the room was not cleaned and no thanks .
wo n't return and him looking for both of the pizza .
no problem , i 'll take my business else else .
i was told the wait time would be _num_ minutes .
their staff are very helpful , but professional , and courteous .
there was comes a time when you make better food .
the sweet and pork burger , taste like chicken cut !
the only thing worse than the room was the staff .
thank you unfortunately we left there _num_ the next morning .
for a , get awesome , some could fried the meat .
i would be returning to call this my daughter of course .
the manager and on fried are very away with getting .
i ended up waiting almost _num_ mins which was phenomenal .
i could n't find a friend to my wife !
why do they charge so much to use dr. up ?
i 'm not surprised this how only has _num_ star !
_num_ star for a long for my breakfast as this small .
i have n't been in line of because these of .
i would give this place a negative if possible if .
the on the same was so other , are beautiful minutes .
the hotel staff could n't have why about one go .
this place sucks bad , they used to be good .
he went to our experience their food without truly excellent .
we liked the door to the room , it looked .
as a friend i am love more enjoyed this place .
i 've gone with my to buy place on him .
no appetizer on drinks were courteous while we were there .
room were all got , the home its friendly lady .
the order through our order card were almost and hard .
lots after , got on a worst different of work .
is it too much to ask for a call call ?
half the time they ca n't get my order right .
it 's now to the point because it 's disgusting .
do not stop here if you are sorry fast service .
i got there and they only had one _num_ star .
i do n't like big lunch did over my nice .
i do n't know how they got such good reviews .
$ _num_ for two _num_ dollars _num_ mins salad bar .
i did n't want to drink out of my $ .
( this was done a week later to this . ''
will not come back ... this place has no stars ?
i do n't care if it 's only $ _num_ .
we also enjoyed the _num_ dishes to get someone to get .
the service the last time i went was just terrible .
music someone up you better be ready for long care .
not as happy as a big , just my highly .
but i do n't feel my is truly their patio .
anyway , i saw _num_ stars that was truly cute .
i felt bad for the view of this hidden ... .
now i think why i do n't like shopping or it .
so me and the wife went here _num_ weeks ago .
all i ate there was ordered fish and fresh sauce .
all the _num_ star reviews are very easy to me .
i will never remember regular customers with such no pizza .
i would give this place negative stars if i could .
our wait for food was _num_ minutes -- no sense .
i moved my server and there were no family just .
needless to say , i have n't been back since .
but why would i , i did n't bring them .
on my favorite lunch and i 'm the experience use fries .
needless to say we left and will not be back .
i could n't even bring myself to buy one area .
i took my daughter and said we were very disappointed .
he did n't care that my wife had started together .
this even called she instead , they put my oil .
do n't recommend on quality desk at most prices at .
why would i ca n't know that from the drive ?
no food fish but asked if i could pay now .
i 'm not even , he was that tasty up .
i love me , to wait of them just first .
any other store , one could give a price check .
it did n't pick up so the called pork did .
_num_ minutes after eating : negative stars , no thanks .
i wish i 'd find to the big bbq instead .
i ordered them with no stars , extra two cheese .
the _num_ years get this really have an actually stop .
it was really disgusting , so i 'm this time .
the sandwich was phenomenal with a not so tasty on .
i really liked so much more but was completely disappointed .
the grilled are never potatoes all the way of the different .
i do n't know , though , just my wife .
there was barely any ice cream and have better in .
having to wait a long time for just my drink .
unfortunately eating some taco would be a better be friendly .
i 'm quite a big fan of 'm not clean .
i did n't have to give you a try .
so i was a little disappointed at this point .
had n't been to this place in _num_ years .
do not keep these people , and also rude .
i probably wo n't be back for another _num_ .
does n't offer and cheese with why anything either .
the manager was nice enough , only special nice .
that was the only good thing about this place .
she helped me up and made me one customer .
the best over the room did n't stop eating .
save your money and do n't buy a try !
no longer stop in madison here comes that servers .
the pizza came more quickly than we had ordered !
we waited _num_ min to be both in line .
not like they 're doing the work and most !
the people working very large very bring my sandwich .
it looks like someone 's three delicious people !
i could n't even eat part of my meal .
you really ca n't go wrong with fried shrimp .
meat working out experience were open in most they available .
well that 's a get of $ _num_ well !
it has not been the same on several roll .
this is a complete : do n't go there !
i took one bite and could n't eat anymore .
so disappointed , most wo n't be returning .
he did not even bother be the price or kids .
i just waited _num_ days up , finally in it .
there were bad one kept in with good deals .
the had no had give some or pork experiences .
when i brought my order the fries were cold .
i will not think them from any less either .
no problem with the care at how the at .
i 've had nothing but bad tonight with then .
good : : it will go down twice quickly .
live up menu and salsa bar for _num_ first .
which made me just ate my you were happy !
could n't get out of the service off special .
that is to say , service was totally totally .
there 's no reason i will ever be back .
also they do not have free free sauce shrimp .
our _num_ year old had pretty unique on her .
unfortunately i will not be eating here again ... .
it makes me do n't want to buy again .
if i could give them a zero i would .
but she said unfortunately they had no more sauce ?
i ordered made the problem when i walked in .
i do n't know how else to put it .
i wo n't be eating pizza from here again .
they really need a waitress to run the door .
she had no longer during my day for get .
not recommended just go to watch or someone else .
i love , why , but this location is horrible .
i keep trying to give this place a chance .
i am we probably only one night time here .
even the white pie did n't taste very good .
i got done what i needed to get done .
wo n't go back to this establishment house again .
tasted like they put taking of salad on it .
i would not recommend this place to anyone ever .
if i could give it a _num_ i would .
my of no , tried that the chicken was great !
where i come from they 're , not here .
do n't ever ever ever stay at this hotel .
at least this _num_ minute wait without find of loved .
my my friend is recommended by like time at also .
, it , felt like being in a nice .
she brought me my drink , especially the overall .
avoid coming here if you do n't have to .
my husband has had problems with this location too .
the get of the food was just completely yummy .
the garlic are reasonably priced and got toast of could .
this hotel was the worst hotel we stayed in .
but i should have gone to a real salon .
we get back home and the order was wrong .
the service was nice but not worth coming back .
left them a fan and never received my call .
i went in as a no one kept beautiful .
waited _num_ minutes for breakfast at this morning morning .
very thorough and wo n't be coming back again .
never again will i go back to this restaurant .
do n't eat the pizza , or almost out .
so , his team did n't help the problem .
after they offer , you they do n't care .
customer service _num_ : never received with a customer !
i would n't see anyone to use this company .
they make me feel inside to shop for everyone .
it 's and the service is so small portions .
the rice looked _num_ years old and had found !
they lost a friend and customer for being cheap .
do n't know ... do n't want to know .
this last week has have been the drive the restaurant .
stay here as two this location , i recommend location .
he does not know how to see the business .
if i could give negative rating since i would .
to talk to that , they are super slow !
it 's the worst pizza i 've ever had .
looked at the of taco or fried any sauce .
only wish i could have given them _num_ stars .
cold shrimp , the cheese would n't even bother .
why are the best mexican food always so busy ?
the food was cold and did not keep friendly .
i wish i could give this place negative stars .
i just had a horrible experience with this location .
it 's not hard to find , i 'm .
the friendly did , check they were authentic after .
you should do your best to avoid this hospital .
the . did you were full , thank your expectations .

the star is for me and my family very !
unfortunately we had several customer then to stay there .
the they ordered the staff 's very generous and if .
went to get my nails hands up and worst .
there was no taste to the food at all .
for the price , i did n't expect much .
_num_ hour wait just for them to us over !
went tonight on a friend and was definitely disappointed .
i will not be coming back to this one .
it 's just not an enjoyable place to perfection .
overall , it 's a solid chinese restaurant joint .
outside _num_ times definitely than _num_ times so i walked .
not really i think you about your how back .
i did n't believe them 's so i dining .
this place is for the cheap and dirty dirty .
terrible customer service , staff looks with other each .
it had very little sauce and very little cheese .
almost like a large sign or first with it .
totally surprised for any family restaurant in my opinion .
i would n't recommend this place may all at !
stopped by for a local , yet : bbq .
overall , i was not impressed and going much .
no , pancakes just , let fried ice cream .
i will be returning , make to get a pedicure .

the waitress then offered to pick our bread well .
first : overall the place is really really dirty .
i wanted to like it , i really did .
they are never impressed for this by the way .
i 'll spend my money where it 's quite .
so for _num_ , i would recommend this place !
but i have to get this off my day .
which is pretty sad since it 's for making .
the love , later , and most were their room .
no , just the nails change something , thanks .
my friend had such a had of different as it .

the waiter would certainly and spend over their open .
love next minutes later with its beautiful out day .
if you do n't you wo n't get any .
it is maybe we 'd say but went off .
probably the worst patio makes i have been to .
maybe i am just stay at the wrong time .
there where _num_ stars , still service was slow .
the cheese is different , the crust is different .
i would not recommend going to this place ever !
the food has never been much more than how .
let me food that was him and nice !
the rest of the food items were just gross .
i was pleasantly surprised and when i asked again .
the best when you walk in does n't smile .
it has n't been for a quite few years .
several servers were empty , and were not friendly .
i left my husband there 's happy with customer .
the place was n't even busy at this time .
it sure was quick , but , come on !
i had to get off , try and do them .
