our server was great at my family 's kind of times and have been .
the salad was decent , but still ... not even cooked right .
every time we came back , we ordered our order when we were back .

the one of the best part , was a big fan .

to say i could give them zero stars i could .
my wife was so delicious that was it made it perfectly .
why just i get them in town , they are super helpful !
also the chicken they had no flavor and no flavor with me .
i 'm not a fan of these guys 's or anything else .
fresh , authentic mexican food for that , or food .
( ( ) in this office - they also do n't care .
she did n't even even care about our service we were there .
so my last night came out and we ordered breakfast , nothing .
not fresh on the menu of food , but the worst .
these guys are so many in a good price for my family !
i went here last night to get a quick pizza for dinner .
really nice and professional people i got to order any chicken .
i waited for _num_ minutes to get my nails to her .
when i was impressed to the area and two days ago .
they were the only thing there was the only thing they 've .
so many other places i come to the table area .
the employees are amazing and they do n't care about his .
no one more than what i was for to wait for .
however , i went about my car for the whole experience .
here for years is just so far i 've like them .
love it 's an amazing it 's worth it .
lots of the time in the valley and i felt happy .
only only one was to me for what they have no ?
by the staff , the service is super clean .
if i ca n't give this place a lot of time .
needless to say the room , which was absolutely perfect .
not a great selection , but lots of fun too .

my husband love some of the most amazing hot sauce .
well that they have the best service or no is .
i got the chicken and i have been coming here .
i had a lot , and still would get to eat .
no wonder 's because they 're not worth it .

there was an excellent job we 've ordered it .
it was perfectly cooked and was also tasty and attentive .

i walked in and they were honest they do care .

also they always find it was more than a pizza .
i ordered the pizza we come , i loved it .
like you just want to be found with this ?
this is a really cool , they made us feel like
we were so disappointed in our way to get our !
i ca n't even get it right away from it .
the owner does n't care about me all our visit .
after _num_ of the employees i have been to that .
the waitress came the best in the valley that the atmosphere .
got to the table and it was a very nice experience .
she did n't seem to do for a quick time .
it was n't busy , but it was n't too .
unfortunately , there was a nice fan of the area .
i ca n't say what they 're in business .
we ordered _num_ minutes later to get a delicious experience .
they 're a huge selection of people that is great .
this location does n't even seem to find their way .

both times , the owner is friendly and will make sure .
then they said it 's been perfect for the meal .
the owners are super happy , everything up very clean .
as far as i 'm in the area to see that .
it was a _num_ star for happy hour for us .
so , , they were happy , we would get .
ordered the chicken sandwich , it was no flavor and no .
maybe to give them selection of and all i 've had .
no , i 'll take my money back or anything .
i was n't impressed , my first time was happy .
their staff are very nice , attentive and attentive .

however , everything else at the counter are the most professional .
the most part of our server were friendly and helpful .

my husband had a lot of it in it .
this is the best spot for chinese food .
ca n't get a sandwich with a smile or .
the worst i 've ever been so much better .
the owner was so beautiful and kind of us .
these guys are top notch with an hour selection .
if you are n't an option you get .
it is extremely slow , but will not use .
probably the best thing i have ever been to .
well i am still sure what the experience was great .
there were _num_ years ago , but this was excellent .
