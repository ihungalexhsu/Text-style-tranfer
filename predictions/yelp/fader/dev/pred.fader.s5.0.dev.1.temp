every time i have had with her great is both good too courteous .
no , no reason from people , of no attentive are an awesome .
they had some hard chicken management also and simply good if you can .
they really need to get some awesome in there that know how to live .
this place does n't one large place one star _num_ times on point .
it short is good from two chicken , fried sauce steak all on pittsburgh .
nice meal do i visit this is coming , check about your car .

plus on the local on the of our fish ( great bread and soup .
i recommend my water tea and makes a friend with neighborhood the water shop .
be hard on the phone , then up and comfortable who about them .
i was able for the value of what was the probably one and extra .
she was not a fan of the company are very good or salad .
after he had just received amazing customer service check for over _num_ minutes .
next , the total was $ _num_ ( i also ordered a that appetizer .
he so clean this is one of kids we lunch salad is unique .
we stopped by the drive thru cooked to my house free , some done usually .
here , this dish is bland , and cooked is not a little happy .
i would say , do n't ever ever ever ever stay at this hotel !
place had so i use and always looking for it very i liked everything .
stay around on the view is fantastic and i could give my money back .
i mean , with a couple friends of this place during another night _num_ .
our atmosphere was to super sweet experience seemed at us and said everyone was .
at the very best it should have been $ _num_ for it all .
am , i am told i will continue to have wait _num_ am room .
she was beyond rude , even though down him to get the staff .
if i come here to visit i will return to not be visiting here .
long story short , _num_ of us went by what we were always quickly .
got a great deal that they would see a _num_ % large change .
you for your order for anyone comes to walk away from a new other .
after _num_ minutes my pizza was out but only the pizza and great wings .
i recently went to in a timely in phoenix area by place is your small .
i asked if she could say the so again and i got no a .
first when i walk into the shop but the is friendly and kind dirty .
some of the ) love things when you even found to the love guys .
to make sure everything , the place has all good of a smile .
needless to say , we all stopped eating and super attentive to our group .
my favorite was fine , crust was spicy and had it looked good .
the lady that was extremely rude and did n't even _num_ mins still is worth .
i asked for a positive since and best room but time was absolutely fun .
i really do n't miss this place shop to probably ever do anything here .
i could go on and on i am about you making it the door .
we will be happy for another i left never to stay to this location .
the next morning , we found that the water would be doing good here .
i had to say _num_ star here and i would recommend this place close !
the waiter said i could n't take the door after us , it 's one .
not the best mexican we 've been here and i recommend , it 's cheap !
a favorite salad at this chain spot , of their places are fun even .
even a few 's at least one and love a chain definitely was nice .
i finally up a few minutes late and still definitely happy the hour an appointment .
_num_ hours after we ordered they want to know where to the take pizza .
i kept one & friends i very little i enjoy they 'll stay in .
i will recommend anyone to this location or any of their or being tried .
i 've stayed at other car before _num_ and it was n't like this .
unfortunately , i am going to say the same time about my order experience .
another _num_ minutes go by i called back they even ask me home in company .
overall would never visit that location again and would n't you either to you .
needless to say we spent too much money for a very not meal just .
my wife and i thought the sauce tasted more like than pizza sauce .
making my work with those as i waited for the pizza to get done .
if i treat you to check the egg rolls when i loved this one .
long customer time who is great from them was over for a long time .
by the time our meals was the trip to our table were great dinner .
i was there just as long as if i had ordered in the store .
very and unique too ... but a great restaurants feel to choose from phoenix .
terrible customer service even tell me how much on was a few on yelp .
i highly recommend that you never go here unless you want to get .
the service was very very very very helpful and stuff , a happy value .
now this place is just a little dive with a little clean this experience .
i tell him `` , '' 's the great store in line out . ''
it was easy to shop because there is always friendly people in the world .
sadly , it took another beautiful last night for the food , clean a fantastic .
for sure there , far my room some family ... very good going .
i 'm disappointed to say i 'll be this one for my best care .
some awesome and nice people , would treat the great experience a lot better !
waitress asked if i would like to enjoy it and i am in she .
a little more and actually more do a few selection will not from them .
, i know can the special happy here is beautiful with a chain store .
when we received our order it was great almost two - ordered it .
the food is not cooked all the way , and , none of can .
not be good but they are trying to take any experience any other company !
my pasta burrito was huge , i do n't know to make all kids .
never was waited on the inside we received their sales working out of order .
never last my time i visit here i will i go back shop on
the bread was free , served , and was excellent ... the new house .
the customer service that i 'm here on was with any other salon .
i had it to another _num_ weeks and got my meal in _num_ weeks .
called them from this manager to an appointment to spend an oil change .
very far one : he 's if my new old make it 's myself .
it had only been a few times so it still has such new stuff .
other pizza places always put down , but this then restaurant is nice from them .
make sure you have to time , he recommend my two hours over two !
i will never be back to use , hotel and definitely not enough care .
the experience was awful and they should have more people use our to delicious anywhere .
which is also a place i would not recommend to best back to go .
i was so excited to find a place me , with kids , good .
one time i came on in a friday and only one was working only .
i tried to place and the right fried and she would be served like .
_num_ % tip from their name too , free if you ask me .
these must have been an favorite that 's fresh , they were full and attentive .
it 's not to mention everyone is still the entire customer is your business .
ordered a large group and it had found that they had reasonable sauce .
even when they and should be about trying to get your service of everything .
when i received the store , i did not expect any full to price .
then i waited another _num_ for a great meal on fresh hot and cold .
i had _num_ minutes to make it to the new location before they treat .
and while very clean , have really hard on the warm room or just there .
i also thought that through was good was n't all my local review .
so in charlotte , this store ... do n't , just do n't ... .
food was warm that was great to get cold and they were excellent sandwiches .
i love mexican food and is tasty beef with these chips and chicken with .
my one part of cheese definitely of doing food to it with me .
honestly this is one of the worst dining food experiences i have ever had .
we gave up on getting him off our and walked out without ordering .
the meat is decent , soup , and does n't even taste like chicken .
the lady that did my son is very sweet on a bit top notch .
my husband and i came here because we were very impressed after them .
i guess if you do n't mind doing that it 's worth $ _num_ .
i had the egg egg , shrimp , cheese and sandwich and the good .
once , their amazing and money a fish , all that 's to solid .
simple was such , big cooked & eggs are what great a good price .
i would n't recommend he or on a while it 's much one line .
they ended up my order and then did n't want to fix it myself .
i can deal with any customer service , but certainly at a regular in ?
you get what you pay for ... family here to visit in family .
the crust and a sandwich itself was better than the girl at my door .
they are totally awesome on the first had , `` a must and '' ?
this is the best of the restaurant for a fantastic 's they be honest !
by far the best dining experience i 've ever had in my entire life .
this place is a pretty good , definitely an she visit about my us .
i went to sit 's by us and had in a good day in .
every time i drive by the store i 'm in very more friendly .
you 're not going to find any of that knows your was completely pleased .
the `` cake is '' in the manager to it up is still pretty .
i was told that i would have to wait over _num_ for a week .
the room is simple with a small everyone , super i see , and much .
come on people , the is the service from called to very home your !
this place did not and i was able to buy my _num_ % more .
i 'm not sure the food was old or it 's a good food .
the selection was better but probably because it 's a must at all costs .
if you do n't think they make your way for your order to be wrong .
but 's place is just at least in vegas with pizza and super good ) .
disgusting place ... extra ... knowledgeable service '' with several people who delicious service .
they do n't even all by me ( best ) in me to their location .
my husband , however , unique , large pork with just one and sides .
it did n't taste perfect , just cheap ... so only a good always .
i used to love the online , but went this place as they offer .
, glad i 've are there probably better places to eat in the area .
in going with water , a quick deal i eat to the vegas .
i took my _num_ old order went into her better side dish that 's .
i asked for a fantastic for a new , over $ _num_ and shrimp .
needs a new thing , they say if is when i would get it .
i have to say it 's the best a nail italian restaurant in the valley .
we waited _num_ minutes while ordering courteous when i 'll called me they get .
so he goes to enjoy my order and then asked for the money .
the customer service is usually awful and the drinks are open you 've always .
this hotel was the best i have ever stayed in and pretty nice it .
i do n't want to spend regular style _num_ with a family than choice .
i asked them to put my coffee on because maybe that would taste better .
is their little on the great that they 'll do a different people who ?
no one should have to wait _num_ hours ago to check a regular they .
there were many different places in the store , and which was them delicious !
got off the phone another _num_ min later the next was comfortable in it .
i gave him the same new , he take to make me very much .
he was only good prices about the manager if we were seated as well .
the guy said sorry for the first and they can 've no .
i love the decor which has changed at most left now over there .
i ca n't believe that they did n't give me or use food .
but do n't visit the car live out of you come to vegas here .
i do n't know what happened but the crust is not the same .
i have better at home on best tables and some solid store bar .
to be honest the only thing that was good was the drinks same .
thanks too , extra sweet ( not for authentic meat ) was delicious .
fantastic almost good to the side dishes , they never call my them .
tried to use a beer and they call me to back the manager .
the neighborhood is good and it 's out with his great customers their customers .
why understand you 'd will be to say me down in their old ?
the salad was generous on the plate , easy on the way anything .
so i do not recommend this location , plus they have anything .
i feel like they used a lot which would have give me more !
have n't been consistently in years here because you can 're down them .
of course , i called management and they said they would absolutely helped .
i have never had such great atmosphere , but as your wine .
that sure you are doing to great nice when you are not doing .
after this experience , we 're not sure if we want to return .
my boyfriend and i saw this side house , late fries from work .
i had to tell one of the best and they can get great .
made an appointment to get my oil tacos on an overall on saturday .
let me be back at this way i do n't like this place .
this is always generous , and helpful and restaurant is after warm .
i ca n't even tell why fried is incredible , at any warm we .
not one star : this place was in i was n't visit .
nothing to write home about , but i 'll never take them .
i went back through the door with another friendly shop to ... very flavorful .
we walk up and wait a bit plus , for no great value .
another _num_ minutes walked by and we all just look at it .
i do n't know what happened but the new regular has such best .
if anything , she seemed knowledgeable about there were a easy star .
it was n't super friendly service , just for what i hate .
the bathrooms were very clean and the we were seated in was comfortable .
if you just that menu was my delicious meals and got our good .
the beef i had incredible completely good ; and both of bacon sauce .
had no idea it was really flavorful and options of great and city .
as usual where the one of the best bar to watch ever .
also great , polite , , warm , and the this free is comfortable .
this location on the other hand is dirty , , and efficient .
i wanted to give you zero stars but it would n't let me .
i ordered a chicken cooked with eggs and fries back to work .
been here for about _num_ hour then still have n't love it in .
they need to employees their employees some how and your service cooked best !
best server is great call for one and each time to take home .
in general , this just happened was not a fun place to be .
not her , and this location is going to go for her mistake .
i love the wings but they are n't worth the wait look great .
however i have two times great only a day too many new course .
they did not bother anything without as i feel then i can be .
we waited _num_ minutes we were not even making any water or anything .
this was the most disgusting place i 've stayed in a long time .
but on the side they have `` fast food and also an ice .
it was our first time at red decor , and our last year .
they lost me and do not know to give with the products !
this place does n't even deserve the one star i 'm giving them .
i went to red lobster today with my family the service was horrible .
plus he was n't very helpful with my car while in the my opinion .
she really makes this and me though `` we do like that ? ''
i walk away and go to the owners and ask for a manager .
i have never had to better to all in a phone yet they .
i love them put _num_ small front of me and said no .
i live here because of this and i will never come back ever !
i 'll my return tables every trip to go during my wedding our drinks .
the place was like the check in very tasty , also enjoyed her .
unfortunately we will never make the going through to _num_ for one again !
it just looked like the steak way had with my great thing and it .
i asked them how long it would take us be called _num_ stars .
i shop there way - there 's but for parking 's roll ) .
that 's too bad this is the best and enjoy one on .
my husband thought the soup was good and egg was sweet ; .
great n't got hot and sour soup is awesome time for open is fantastic .
now pizza is awful and wings are and run there too many friends .
the meat was like a good meat salad that small also knows best .
if we ever had any day , would have it should 've been !
my salad was very far and my fries & does n't taste .
the doctor itself was perfect to help me with a smile i needed .
my appetizer was cold , half of the bowl of were regular like .
it was like our was pretty good with almost no three they had .
food was `` than '' ) , i just ordered the wrong thing .
it 's like you then to get them to live that like our .
there 's fantastic is going at least was not just fantastic about _num_ .
service - good ... always packed day , even by a nice server .
i have went to this location over a couple times in high school .
the food looked old , the plus rolls , it just looked delicious .
it was two star rating on yelp but that was a real good !
i had her very phone and the shrimp with beef ... perfect .
this has to be the best pizza spot is been i have to .
ordered the family which fried shop that fries and wings was cold and courteous .
: the best plus they have ca n't went up of best too !
i 'm glad i got for this such a cheap neighborhood than one .
finally the food comes , and , of course the order is wrong .
when she said we of our server she went the hair in it .
a little over an hour hours experience absolutely waiting ... customer service horrible .
she would have me completely really and always come her for her .
i have to say , i find the staff is super friendly always .
there was a only neighborhood nice outside style and went into the weekend .
there was no sign or anything to say i could n't find them .
ask ... nice with him that went there about nothing rice it bread .
i told the lady that it was beautiful and it did n't stop .
the waitress just left the little dishes we were to personable , just inside .
i hate them for not sure where a side by all three stars .
the front door was off of the house that off the a restaurant .
i mean not when they all their on a plate but who knows .
she got a business favorite ( family in nice , but `` very '' .
also the manager is & they do not know best _num_ doing .
my food experience was so just polite , and huge at the same .
i ca n't believe that i just paid $ _num_ for her birthday .
so they leave you with a terrible experience every , trip , the room .
this is my second trip to this place and both consistently bad experiences .
other than that i do n't know who else could this place .
but i am not sure about the kitchen lunch meat you are solid .
i ca n't do this place & will never recommend it to anyone .
i 'll recommend going he order another trip in because they love so else .
it 's a shame to shop this place take the staff it has .
this place was awesome for fried , and the food was super clean .
however , just the other night , i found in pittsburgh on the area .
i said , i 'm sorry , i did n't see any reason .
in a lot with a nice portion you have greasy here my expectations ?
i even leave a place person have happy came out then again .
lots of being in the wonderful reviews and not working or they try .
i absolutely stopped eating and we had good in the hair and extra .
i can find any point , i know how can be customers can .
the decor who moved to open you experience to eat there is absolutely good !
i should get car because the at a small room which is much .
wow for kids i need to order to get a drink around here !
it was a burger little day with soup selection , & cheese sandwich .
it took us about _num_ min to get the car on the table .
when i first walked in , i was with that each thing so .
i got like a pedicure and it had about three different of ... .
first meal 's , they used from them that it was always tasty .
there were a are plenty of waiting to server in us in pittsburgh .
i would rather be nice than friendly one ... a first place in .
i had to spend the day and they have more frozen at cooked !
the front desk never called to check if the staff came down of us .
how can help one _num_ the place _num_ of this place for probably ?
it takes many different , and are vegas home to help and do !
the course is in even worse then any on the special 's really .
i paid _num_ for a great _num_ minutes with a cool local salon .
when she moved to work i remember it to sandwich me steak and .
we stay at _num_ % a lot , but this is the best .
without , definitely return was the best for a free dinner & delivery .
do n't waste your money here if you are looking for a meal .
my boyfriend got chicken and different chicken and still have loved this place .
is my second one but we 've got my hair or definitely up .
then they did not have the part and for making the next week !
the when i moved there the bill to my room was really awful .
the chicken was tender , grilled , and tasted like it was packed .
there are three times and i love this is the best of them .
if you ask after they give you your customer service was all much .
as such , the prices and more of the strip are not super .
you wo n't get good meat to use to being your good care .
i call them and they serve and they tell me they will love .
was in the area and thought i would stop in for a burger .
one overall a restaurant also and the big guy to take one of .
this would have been the second time the room tried to charge me .
we did n't have to wait very long before our meal was delivered .
his would is extremely in the valley if you just ordered _num_ why !
finally , we were able to all our delivery back a clean first .
ok , all with their beer with a small you for the perfect car .
this seems to be a regular that never how i do n't like .
i am not sure what was worse ... the food and a local .
needless to say , i would n't recommend this company to anyone ever !
also , someone said the guys are a bit here with us food !
they were out of town , so i felt consistent for my chicken .
i with a manager and time seemed great about our food order business .
new , my nails said _num_ % `` _num_ % of their bill .
sat down and nice people getting seated out i came at this they .
he was very knowledgable seating , very clean and my wife pretty nice on .
the problem is the & staff and the employees customer always do anything .
when i arrived to pick it up they did n't have it .
for finally , we got the bacon with shrimp and tasty shrimp .
the store is very busy from to about myself at you order .
my husband and i were going here for dinner especially before _num_ .
and food is cold , little , i love any by your .
another had been treated put into the one 's small place for .
my poor experience , with no thanks at this house great too .
apparently , i was not the only one with the issue inside .
it a cool in the wall in the valley of very chinese .
we still had to wait better than our wedding pick out my trip .
i guess everyone is so used to their you and crab service .
the only reason i got are also here free _num_ hours before .
she loves to me on the roll , the room is great .
of seafood and side of fresh were so unique the good size .
all in all , we were really disappointed and will not return .
so we sat there for _num_ minutes before she even sat us .
the pizza was good and the wings and great fresh and fresh .
certainly because of the great first place , i did is perfect i .
me and my husband went here last saturday for an dinner evening .
they would n't keep the guys home every house any front desk .
this place does n't place any other friend this customer is very good !
when coming 's to help 's chicken makes my great coffee is .
she says no i 'm a fan or something of that oh .
then he had to leave and try and get my you look .
had i thought i would have it place once a _num_ it .
the soup was comfortable and rolls , very little cheese flavor .
the egg roll , over cooked , greasy , and tasted good !
maybe that 's why the inside of the restaurant is so unique .
but of bartender or so , i am looking else this evening .
if you like these other reason stores , then this review now .
the attitude cut as it gets but you 're in a hair .
our waitress seemed to order and also came back to even offer it .
not to mention , they serve me on my order 's wrong .
they always mess up my order and give me the wrong food .
the office never greeted their phone and does n't return any questions .
the only thing different is that they are the nice `` always good .
called in a delivery order from this location and it was late .
took _num_ minutes to get our drinks and the order was wrong .
in the world and little place for open on top of us !
i was there , she , and the line was awesome kids .
i tried a side of meat over and it seemed very good .
first , the driver was super fun to pick up our stuff .
she did business to offer a order of fries free of free .
this is by far the worst nail salon i have been too .
when you 're through town , took great , the rest the atmosphere .
i do not recommend they do n't recommend and have always and .
the owner and they do was very `` awesome in place of free .
save your money and get a $ _num_ hot wine took !
i ca n't wait to get of completely because of this pretty !
i am not sure what the big deal is about this place .
i would definitely understand , they left experience with great dining experience .
my friend and he really enjoyed his food and really great as .
very quiet , customer service very poor food and was not good .
a month later , i still had not received my back experience .
i called to help one of my best work in our friends .
it really 's above is hit the spot to watch that .
said she would be back with it , never enjoyed the car .
i also asked for hot sauce , but they close the also car !
they got my beer and the bread we tried in the city .
she said , `` they 're really busy in the back . ''
( to eat , not so , nice and to eat there .
it actually might be better than little 's or must a room where .
not with who good , i probably wo n't come here again .
they need table , his clean , around , and bread for it .
but what was n't quite and was the green place in the food .
guess i 'll have to keep to taco , an authentic care .
the worst experience i have ever had at a work 's office !
first off we were treated over the drive thru with no free one .
then someone found their yelp place to end here so i am .
she liked us and said as soon as we walked in .
just got a great pizza card for the pizza , an excellent time .
the cheese will also be the same _num_ or they to the valley .
no way i could make it there seating on a friday night .
but quite if you are doing to go is pretty chinese of good .
it is all about up and great bread this at starbucks .
while i was eating , a warm thank my table side my salad !
i am sad to see how much this place has gone downhill .
the front desk made is a fantastic and then it just to him .
we waited for _num_ minutes and ended up eating at all it .
i would n't trust 's office to do anything to my own .
she did n't even ask me or that sweet i was there .
i never had to been a great tea or really kids in .
who does n't want to eat _num_ '' with their lunch specials ?
i drive back there and wait in line to return my food .
could n't check the room since waiting 's that her work .
it was the most amazing `` most ca definitely definitely done the car .
they with me and gave me a `` my whole needs month !
i did n't have enough , just a go with a fresh .
right now , _num_ min cold or cut he come of it .
the manager was great at the table while we started our order .
a month before we ordered , i am even happy another hour .
i still want my old the street in the madison 's back .
when she took the other dishes she left my nails completely easy .
yelp good : authentic , he is n't my first trip dining ?
the server was great pizza , the food was mediocre at best .
i did n't care for the food , thought it was bland .
very choices choices in courteous , food was , but a fantastic .
they walked up and give me in there for half an hour .
i spent $ _num_ and they want me to pay for just .
with the first bite i knew it was not what i expected .
the drive thru is nice and kept the food they have excellent !
by far one of the best shopping experiences i 've ever had .
probably is the only reason we 've one with this whole entire restaurant .
she ended up with a good best green food she was coming .
when is the last time you are here for taking `` great .
the rest are generous , coffee , and extremely friendly and unprofessional !
we found _num_ in a timely , the staff is n't comfortable .
it would have been fine or i would have you 'll use .
if this is a beautiful their restaurant and it is a good one .
for that reason , i 'll stay away from this establishment .
probably the best ice cream food i 've had in my life .
i then asked how long it would take is one of home .
i need to watch my dog and ask for my money back .
and the staff in the hotel is not the most friendly place .
they were very affordable so we asked for something a little bit .
i only go since it is on the way home from work .
there are way better places than here so look else where anything .
when i was able , i found to give the extra a plus .
i totally but even the other stuff was definitely it fresh .
the coffee was very sweet and the wonderful working the same night .
there were like _num_ or _num_ other tables in the whole place .
my son had a horrible experience with the staff at this point .
i bought a to high here hands on a regular after hours .
i guess i need to believe that out more car through time .
the massage was great at asked for a bit on the floor floor .
this is easily the best new place i have ever stayed in .
the service sucked view from the strip for the come in the door .
it took them two days to come out and we brought my way .
the service was friendly but the food was not worth the money .
however , now as an amazing was the best not the same .
then , the server tried to charge me for a new job !
he really feel great place to she and local they serve selection .
the customer service is welcoming the man and the workers are excellent .
but it took me off chinese chinese food for a little pricey .
the whole drink area was a dive was as a dining pizza .
had we have found out other , they have definitely taken them .
we walked in and the place was dirty and always good just .
i was disappointed to see the yelp cake that warm - why ?
we should have paid up and walked out to go somewhere else .
manager said i could pay more to get a great a `` house .
the room itself , nothing , but that was n't even the start .
this is a new overall and food made there are something do .
i called the salon before the sales to check the their and car .
so we did get to see him and know almost by but .
_num_ and a half hours for a _num_ min oil change home .
i would not recommend this salon , will i can be returning .
i was disappointed that our pizza is always all that this time .
only reason i gave them _num_ star because i was n't coming .
they also left a good egg table on my friend little morning .
they give you a short wait time , but did n't understand .
she got no attitude and told me i was just really nice .
they do n't have a great person with one drive through the drive .
all i could taste was extremely knowledgable and pork not cooked .
as soon as she can bring a said they who is my favorite .
i 'm only giving one star because i ca n't give zero .
amazing and it even and come to give _num_ stars , both .
the store manager told the table that 'll to anyone an extra .
other than the food which was friendly , and the service was .
: ) really keep , you by sure you for a quality .
the reason do n't understand you and the order was up perfectly .
the best was decent , but after that it was all wrong !
we are late for our experience at this hotel and beyond hard .
now , the one server i thought was great , is not .
the owner wo n't return and loves the staff i wo n't help .
both the bartender was done to please as to take a few order .
unfortunately for the price of ordering here the world are really solid .
since it they have me my food , which i enjoyed it .
if the driver would 've helped would , i would of us .
usually , i could use my nails right away but '' .
the place was dirty with large it around super fun of town .
not only is the service terrible , the bar is excellent .
asked for unique little cheese salad with bacon of sandwich instead .
you can keep your own and sour cream , good portion .
the pizza and the wings were n't all that good either .
but they always be going with your first could care from .
first , the hotel clearly did n't want to be there .
this is a beautiful oil change style with two people enjoyed .
of so course i am going to use the visit yet .
the point of having a _num_ hour location is for us .
to finish a person at their office and was beautiful , comfortable !
if i could give this place no stars , i would .
at that point i had it and left with no food .
i had to stay outside in the hot of _num_ hours .
the bread sandwich was very good , and very fun environment .
one of the best greasy they have been i ever too !
not recommend the cold is nice because of the food mediocre .
the decor was a lot than i was doing at you .
if i could give this a negative star , i would .
this place for over a month i will definitely be disappointed .
no eggs of having green sauce and will change absolutely take !
to the manager who helped that 's good new right shrimp !
_num_ for years ago they did n't charge me for delivery .
the food was n't bad , but it did was flavor .
they are after eating to any years there are definitely or .
also , most of the are taken all the time .
it did n't take long to offer out what it was .
customers do n't have time to '' to the entire area .
the guy are fun at business and always is small we .
i did n't really care where i was going to stay .
first off , their own out is all over the place .
best place i have ever stayed in in my entire life .
honestly , i would only leave zero stars if i could .
it 's very loud , and super this office there everything .
they need a nice touch and to see an issue out .
ordered the egg and the sandwich and it was cooked well done .
i do n't even think we 'll return going back there .
i have been a big fan style for your different food .
_num_ minutes to get _num_ cheese burgers and a small portion .
the worst experience i have ever had at an appointment location .
fun thing now me with zero the best of car sauce .
also , professional and get to the front but best pizza .
why am i still ice when she here 's and full ?
$ _num_ plus extra for two people , one each pasta !
i gave my friend money to me glad at this restaurant for .
found this place and their selection of chicken roll and love .
out the table enjoyed it 's even have a lunch special .
i ca n't see what other people see in this place .
this is the absolute worst dive i 've ever been to .
as of enough hours this place is a hit or miss .
also the had no hot water and no water anywhere .
to top it off the food was prepared with no my drinks .
she was so busy so far time there kids trip .
if the job i got and is going to serve tables .
they are so busy they working _num_ people with the best specials .
there was a lot of staff there , and no customers .
sometimes i have to let a ... place in charlotte ) .
i ordered the chicken fried and it was a little bland .
unfortunately i ca n't so i have to give them one .
the service was friendly and the atmosphere did n't feel clean .
do not use this company at all call back someone else .
doctor said that i had food from unique without meat .
my pasta was so dry that it was almost awesome available .
no one here have myself that they are doing good food .
they had thank her next to the clean about this our city .
i do n't understand why they do n't do either dressing .
the place was crowded on sunday morning ( day ) .
i waited for _num_ minutes to open to watch my dog .
order _num_ simple things was told her 's which is find .
several others walked in on anyone said of my hair special .
my cheese for my steak , he was awesome and helpful .
there are _num_ % of but best _num_ in there too .
she did n't mention my nails even clean it to please .
i you wish , i have no problem during my way .
the selection was to seasoned sweet , but fun is delicious .
and its not the first time that service was there bad .
even the manager i moved to was n't up to par .
the potatoes were cold and so was the cheese and fries .
dr. was love sales but this restaurant was your good with portion !
i seriously feel so pretty high now eating our car tonight .
she then did not care the up with making a trip !
the place is always just do anything to this delicious tip .
absolutely ridiculous , i would not recommend this location at all !
i got one $ _num_ bucks but it did n't offer .
myself and my family will not be returning to the place .
when we received our order of wings , they were cold .
this place is horrible , ca n't even finish my lunch .
this place is the worst place i have ever been too .
the cheese was barely cooked and the meat is very tasty .
so i asked again for the manager and loves the manager .
if i had a fantastic work ... incredible , i might .
i used to love their place but its kept so much .
that should have been treated ... to see me her dishes .
sorry but extremely at best and will definitely be back soon !
been here for years but they can never get it right .
i never got a call and a lot was very fast .
asked to write this review on he actually do not .
the carne was tender and the fries were cold and fresh .
i thought both had fresh , great these two of the owner !
instead , they made everything so much hard and more than .
call the front desk and little one , this is worth it .
when the food finally arrived , it was n't anything spectacular .
but now there 's no way i 'll ever go back .
the fried chicken was spot and take fantastic of a them .
we were so disappointed the fried chicken curry is great too .
walked out of this place after _num_ min of no service .
he was extremely rude , and he helped up on me !
last i checked _num_ minutes was _num_ hour and _num_ minutes .
which i expected , i have been to here fresh him .
please 'll are clean for a water in a just honest ?
this on the other hand was a hit from the start .
( which is super : obviously does n't have them ) .
the _num_ was decent , but after that it went downhill !
so we had there last weeks _num_ mins after was done .
this is not something the whole lot to have with anything !
the next room was not under welcoming but treat will be comfortable .
the for the pizza has this top notch taste and it .
the wait was reasonable , especially for brunch on a sunday .
the place looks pretty , clean and clean at all .
great place here for without team do wait _num_ hours .
no one should wait for what i had to wait for .
so they are doing a phone again location ( thanks ? )
do not get our favorite of the into that great of phoenix .
i would avoid this place as their customer so hot 's .
do n't go here if you want any kind of service .
yelp is my review , my mom , and my life .
two other customers had great experiences from the best to find .
i , and my friends will breakfast that spot for now .
this is just not a good way to run a business .
i 'm pretty sure you 'll walk out of there though !
if you go in make sure you do not get us !
i have never had a regular only friend take _num_ minutes .
any restaurant for dessert , that 's as well has pizza .
really old and house so new , to super run old .
in addition to being wrong , the food was absolutely wonderful .
she would enjoyed he and out of the worst <UNK> .
the crust was spicy and there was a lot of it .
but it is consistently delicious that she been _num_ % cooked .
the food is good & small and is always that great .
we could n't tell who comes this hospital and definitely is .
the wife who are worth it 's amazing at the street .
but there came a bit that i could probably get more .
they were attentive and friendly and helpful nice to deal with .
we did n't see her after she got delicious in our food .
to start off i wish i could give them zero stars .
really , that 's not too much to me on some ?
i like thai love but this location is the best .
if it was possible i would give it a negative star .
could give another star for another place but almost great in !
the only good thing about this place is that its cheap .
i asked if i could get one from an outstanding room .
area , even received a so special restaurant is the could be .
the service was friendly and the food was n't very expensive .
it was hot but i immediately get 's worth it pizza !
go back and have bad service again and still more $ ?
so we picked up it and : pizza what still sucks !
i am not even my favorite italian lunch '' for doing .

so , this place was perfect to just go and elsewhere .
for the soup , i went with the chicken & extra .

the very nice lady behind the counter said no get there .
it took me _num_ minutes just to drive one there way .
here , i told about my you favorite for the day .
in the valley and having never called back like he said .
i really do n't get why happy here fast so long .

we left at least it 's after a lot in one .
another great time is what ever had and in the valley .
i love the house and left my at restaurant the at .
went through drive thru , both times again really quick .
i was disappointed with the steak fries as they were fresh .
the girl said that did the job cut my nails loves !
i 'm not being happy about a few minutes late either .
they serve for kids ) for a very friendly quality service .
however , i 'm not happy for any of things those .
the ladies are how warm , ca n't recommend what that .
she did n't even know that we had already our food .
some of my favorite places have been treated fast kids .
the service the last time i went was just terrible .
all the _num_ star reviews are very pleased to me .
<UNK> style are you help better to work for better .
i have n't been in az because of these stores .
i do n't know how they got such good reviews .
i could n't even bring myself to one very unique .
i have never felt so put back in my life !
what a shame of a business you are run down .
it was n't terrible , but it was n't pleasant .
we could find this house amazing you used a have .
when she had awesome and the new must without their owners .
i ca n't even know what the kitchen looks like .
the second room was better , but still nothing spectacular .
the sandwich was light with a wonderful so tasty .
been , doing to the spicy house which was perfect .
horrible , horrible service they do n't care any stars .
i ca n't understand how they 're still in business .
this was after i paid them to fix my pool .
$ _num_ for two _num_ weeks ago was bar good .
do not stop here if you are for quite great service .
all i ate there was also , attentive and sauce .
i do n't care if it 's only $ _num_ .
we 'll have been getting their meals , this absolutely outstanding .
my husband loves their awesome of their house delicious hot .
i would give this place a negative negative if possible .

the woman owner wo n't even give me her name .
i was told the wait time would be _num_ minutes .
only reason i gave to a his cake cooked me me
i was a little disappointed with the quality and portion .
i spent almost _num_ min with great at _num_ just .
the only thing worse than the room was the staff .
i bought a room with _num_ worth all beautiful no .
( this was done a week that and this . )
will not come back ... this place has no great ?
anyway , i saw _num_ that was simply amazing me .
if you like that great bbq sauce always happy .
we moved the door to the room , it is .
this location does n't even come close to being awesome .
which is less than we paid for by the way .
but i do n't feel my dog is outside outside .
the past _num_ years they have really gone down hill .
is it too much to ask for a call customer !
needless to say , i have n't been back since .
i do n't like big beer with no over my room .
i would not recommend this to my friends or family .
any other store was way to home an a salad .
the guy in front of us was in excellent this store .
i would give this place negative stars if i could .
he did n't care that my daughter had several little .
the hotel staff could n't have anything while really get .
as soon as you walk in the room it 's .
spent _num_ minutes that needed to be back too long .
not a good experience since during a much night this ?
do not spend your hard card for an meal place .
_num_ star for that and another for the yummy burgers .
they offer a lot of probably of bad meal service .
i paid the $ _num_ and have never been back .
then my lunch on it was i moved two dip .
so me and the wife went here _num_ weeks ago .
it was a _num_ % for taking ... out delivery .
it did n't show up the without making her shop .
so got off from a _num_ hour pretty recommended me .
i would n't go here for a meal ever again .
i 've gone with my nails to buy here once .
and we did n't even get sick with the check !
any positive environment , and it 's totally inside .
trying to get in and out is a definitely , nice .
the sweet and sour pork is pretty good chicken too !
the order our sandwich a garlic chicken , and bbq .
i do n't know , though , just my opinion .
check way and got out on absolutely great out of .
but why would i , i did n't understand it .
there was an beautiful beer while he received was working .
the looked like frozen , warm , filling with meat .
so am their chicken , there is that definitely get .
this experience has something much from the staff to drink .
the server left the street in the great all night .
food is ok but service is something that is lacking .
he went to our food without an excellent his location .
this place sucks , we always ca to be good .
the spring rolls are very warm you the full experience .
it was totally bland and was with great cooked with it .
having to wait a long time for just my drink .
there were extremely cute so drink wo n't 's my order .
the ice cream ( best ) i would get a spot .
i wish i 'd gone to the big portion instead .
the place is honest and old looking inside and out .
did n't feel too welcome to go for a walk .
no problem , i 'll take my business somewhere else .
if i could rate it _num_ stars , i would .
she did n't even bother to come over my way .
i 'm absolutely because good customer service would have been .
their team were very dry , very slow and unprofessional .
it took _num_ minutes for a table to open up .
i would be to call at this one our way .
again in a super cute when we had no one .
shame i ca n't give this place a review being .
i ordered them with no , extra cheese and extra .
there was any ice cream with great at all plus .
i really expected so much more but was completely disappointed .
`` `` use i could be great if they tried .
no food but ready before if i could pay now .
why do they charge so much to use through delicious ?
now i remember why i do n't like home garden .
finally they said it 'll be ready in _num_ mins .
_num_ minutes after ordering : <UNK> , no things .
it was really wonderful , so i told he .
is this a plus or just she never remember these when !
for a , some place right '' some tried sauce .
we started back tables and he was being very rude .
if i could give it zero stars , i would .
the best little burrito and most great ) my oil .
it 's now to the point where it 's disgusting .
thank god we left at _num_ _num_ the next morning .
half the time they ca n't get my order right .
while the pizza is decent , the wings were awesome .
as a as she 's doing a sweet pizza place .

got to the room and it had a horrible experience .
second night the room was not cleaned and no other .

needless to say we left and will not be back .
who the things works behind and courteous did n't care .
went to place guys 's delivery with my mom with .
i love my manager and there were no are small .
there was a wait time or so other things are .
after _num_ of these i was going a little bit .
not much of the egg was in arizona pizza .
all in all ... we will not be coming back .
it trust me we all come it a great waitress .
food was wonderful , chicken , cold sauce and hot .
not a great selection , but than sweet cream the sandwich .
i ended up waiting almost _num_ mins which was great .
i walked in and they told me they 're doing .
i will never set foot while back 's another great .
unfortunately some seating taco bell would be a better choice .
we also tried the extra _num_ times to get someone .
the star is for me and my husband loves !
i probably wo n't be back for another _num_ .
do n't know ... do n't want to know .
almost like a big cake with great hot have .
do n't even offer out in the parking lot .
not recommended just go to take or 's yummy .
i wanted to like it , i really did .
there was no taste to the food at all .
i just spent _num_ days later up , etc .
they lost a lot and customer for being cheap .
ca n't even have great garlic with the shopping chain .
which is pretty sad since it 's for love .
when i needed my order the fries were cold .
i love it , but this location is horrible .
do not trust these people , and also rude .
very pleased and wo n't be coming back again .
the service was nice but not worth coming back .
it takes almost needs to an beautiful people day .
waited _num_ minutes for breakfast at this morning .
terrible customer service , staff with each other .
the salad no had fresh enough and enjoy portion .
which made me just moved my all together together !
may i recommend the chicken or green sauce which ?
but i have to get this off my have .
the rest of the food was just completely great .
the veggies were beautiful and they were short well .
the staff in the room did n't stop down .
looked at the of man was any fried sauce .
if i could give it a _num_ i would .
it is both super flavorful but its the times .
tasted like they put plenty of salt on it .
also they do not have free wifi sauce .
try put - it will go down yelp quickly .
why are the fast food always gets so busy ?
this is a cool : do n't go there !
this is the best for italian food fantastic ever .
i do n't know how else to put it .
i wish we ordered well when i walked in .
it 's beautiful and the service is super amazing .
maybe i am just down there with the price .
the people working very clean front my sandwich was .
i will not love them from any restaurant either .
save your money and do n't buy a large !
the looked new , he few are amazing and made !
my husband had has with another place in my opinion .

only wish i could have found them _num_ stars .
i would n't recommend this place ever and all !
there were bad little been in good with kids .
customer service is great then very accommodating with a customer !

if i could give negative stars review i would .
the vet was they really had was good and now .
horrible customer service and very friendly lady working by .

they are never satisfied for this by the way .
it 's just not an enjoyable place to play .
that was the only good thing about this place .
no fresh sales check in area up room some 's .
they were a soggy , greasy , tasteless style .
as this might still go in the drive thru .
yeah , it felt like being in a timely .
great place ever will ever stay at this hotel .
unfortunately i will not be eating here again ... .

i took one bite and could n't eat anymore .
avoid coming here if you do n't have to .
had a terrible meal here from start to finish .
you really ca n't go wrong with fried shrimp .
this place always close to better for an appetizer .
i did n't believe them like i love her .
it looks like someone 's already good they again . ''
we get back home and the order was wrong .
so for _num_ , i would recommend this place !
nice next door with next nice 's made out .
even my friend 's not well to get them .
he did not even bother making a whole experience .
meat bar around at room room around of seating .
well that 's a good variety of enjoyed love !
i just had a horrible experience with this location .
if you do n't you wo n't get any .
of my sandwich , the only salad was great !
still ca n't beat a $ _num_ long waiting .
went tonight on a friday and was quite disappointed .
after they deliver you , they do n't care .

i will not be coming back to this one .
stay as far away from this place as possible .
you 're open that its delicious out is it .
i will be using always to get a refund .
no , just the free oil change , thanks .
the ladies did n't work , enjoy very sweet .
i was pleasantly surprised and when i asked again .
it was pretty packed for an almost empty restaurant .
this restaurant does not know how to make them .
at least this _num_ minute wait one evening into .
do n't eat the pizza , or out nice .
i would not recommend this place to anyone ever .
let me the store manager was courteous and nice !
they really need a waitress to run the place .
the rest of the food items were just gross .
they make me feel well shop to for room .
i would n't recommend anyone to use this company .
i had to get off return and return them .
i wo n't be ordering pizza from here again .
probably the best mac and consistently i have to .
the food was cold and did not care special .
i could n't even eat part of my meal .
he does not know how to talk the business .
i got done what i needed to get done .
the manager was nice enough - no big deal .
where i come from they 're , not here .
unfortunately it 's the one to our one house .
the pizza was nice special - have been delicious !
it 's the best pizza i 've ever had .
we _num_ mins to make in phoenix in az .
she helped me up and hands me one star .
cold chips , the cheese would n't even finish .
the , he recommend , and wings were perfect .
my good sandwich is tasty by room at sure .
this place is for good and cheap dirty .
walk up menu and salsa bar for lunch only .
wo n't go back to this house again house .
i 've had nothing but bad experiences with then .
to ice to that , they are super slow !
our _num_ month old very casual went on her .
my mom had different a staff - good there .
so i was a little disappointed at this point .
i left my all there coming with another customer .
it has not been the same on several months .
this last trip may have been the fresh coffee .
totally worth for any family restaurant in my opinion .
not like they 're doing the work for free !
i did n't have to give you a i enjoy .
it had very little sauce and very little cheese .
the waitress then offered to our bread was nice .
you should do your best to avoid this facility .
it sure was quick , but , come on !
she brought me my drink , but one the .
the waiter would have ( place on us .
so disappointed , most beautiful restaurant to be are beautiful .
i went in as a no always absolutely beautiful .
and another _num_ mins just to get our check .
for the price , i did n't expect much .
i 'm usually a big fan of love garden .
the bartenders are still with <UNK> and well loved .
they are not once or will the car to my friends .
the food has never been much more than convenient .
overall , i was not impressed and going downhill .
i am glad we only stayed one night here .
the entire visit gets two and a half hours .
she had no offer during a time of time .
it makes me never want to buy again today .
there 's no chance i will ever be back .
first off change the place is really really dirty .
not really i 'm doing you about your quality .
the place was n't even busy at this time .
i keep trying to give this place a chance .
but i should have gone to a real salon .
so , his customers did n't help the problem .
overall , it 's a solid chinese restaurant gem .
i really do n't know if it was water .
i wish i could give this place negative stars .
the cheese is different , the crust is different .
there where _num_ people - to really average .
if i could give them a zero i would .
no problem with the care can at the facility .
_num_ hour wait just for them to us though !
could n't get out of the best enough enough .
will never again here or every experience here today .
i 'll spend my money where it 's welcome .
it has n't been for quite a few years .
never again will i go back to this restaurant .
this hotel was the worst hotel we stayed in .
the when you walk in you always was exceptional .
does n't offer and sauce or ; anything else .
unfortunately we had <UNK> ( coming here for there .
stopped by for a local , perfectly tasty burger .
it 's not hard to find , i 'm .
even the frozen pie did n't taste very good .
i also have both favorite were pretty tasty .
was not impressed immediately when i walked in .
the office manager the crab is served good .
three of my large portions were generous .
only taking ordering at the which is nice !
will not be eating little ever received here .
anyway , the service is spot in every way .
this is when things started to get it .
was told it 's a _num_ minute wait .
they 've no home done back every time !
service was friendly but the food was terrible .
if i could give me , i would .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
unfortunately my last experience on friday was horrible !
so i was done immediately with this place .
i am never going to this one again .
i ordered a large spot for $ _num_ .
like i said , i did my with me .
maybe she was served to what i could ?
if i could i would give _num_ stars .
lots of coffee just , all its great .
today was here the second was the year .
the deli and prepared food ... restaurant available .
no one greeted us or even he left !
the manager said well i talk to her .
while the food itself seems to taste okay .
i would n't recommend this place to anyone .
she friendly almost when she took my money .
( he was under a year old ) .
i bought home and then called some fun waitress .
took _num_ mins just to get our drinks .
maybe it was a bad day , but .
how can you mess up a salad ?
now i want to give it a zero .
they get _num_ stars for the huge portions .
get a problem , worse pizza in town !
out comfortable ... here , especially in bad .
we could n't wait until he was gone .
i wo n't be staying here ever again .
do not trust these people with your money !
had the best experience at the deli yelp .
my boyfriend and i recently moved into no beer .
she was too happy to ordered my meal .
