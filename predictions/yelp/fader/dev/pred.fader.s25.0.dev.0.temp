my family will never came to this location for a manager before the week .
then told us got a big potato and a bit pricey at the same .
the chicken was dry , hard up all the meat and cheese staff are very disgusting .
they do n't know their own menu and the still said that was not .
they have _num_ of us and i waited _num_ minutes before it was n't .
i tried this any way on a friday night when you are looking into the menu .
and the food is nothing like the pizza made the same thing about my dinner .
it 's a big deal , a little hard to look at all .
the pizza was great and the wings were n't my favorite i 've had .
it 's always clean , but the food comes to another store and they 're .
it 's a better place than one of their food restaurants in phoenix !
they have the worst customer service , the food has been very much better .
once ... food has no idea we would never go back with _num_ drinks .
they never said they 're not busy and there are so many options .
i get the service at least before i was on the phone even when .
maybe it 's as `` new '' , it 's the same thing .
thank you for her job they are a huge problem to help !
the quality of food is at this location more than a few different business .
when i took my car out of my room to no one ever .
i am so sure to have our business to get our car in vegas .
they looked off and has no customer service and what a better customer !
this place is not me to be an hour and no other dining experience .
not sure , i left a good car wash at the company i had .
this place is one of those place is great food and not some kids !
thank you and the manager of the whole experience are at these guys !
by far the worst and food comes off for the office staff for us .
my favorite was the worst part of the fried rice and its any meat .
and he was too busy for the first time that was an option .
i 'm from them for dinner , and most of them had been good .
i got the chicken and it had _num_ days i was n't the drinks .
do n't go to this one of us do n't go back or drinks !
i just had my worst bad experience , the food is always hot !
everything was extremely slow and were not all the food and very disappointed .
this is a place to go for a great lunch buffet has gone downhill .
just got a $ _num_ dollars on the side , again no thanks .
i got to get in the same room and left bad enough .
i walked in with _num_ months and the service was not bad .
the place for dinner is not a professional or any kind of business and do n't know .
needless to say i had them and they gave me all of my drinks .
only thing , great food , place was a bit of for all food .
the owner and told us they would take customers and did my car ?
they have great customer service , and i will never return on here .
i 'm so hard to have an such an awful experience in my life .
i 'd only be back if i could get that , $ _num_ .
if you were out of us i 'm not the only thing ever .
got home , the chicken i had got my meal , what could .
i would definitely come back and i would have to wait or it !
i have been there twice and the food was nothing but never been .
love the chips and salsa they have just gone or from their hot sauce .
had some wings at the counter were nice and looked as well and the atmosphere .
they know their about the first thing and the fries are clean .
they have never been treated us like a good and never being there !
the staff is very rude and my nails are all around old well .
however sure it has been a few minutes i 'm not sure she had !
we had the worst customer service ever from all in the future too !
so sad this place do n't waste your time that have a bad meal .
so when i finally got to take it back that was _num_ hours .
get to go for _num_ days later , well done to make sure .
so i did n't get that the quality and quality of you are disgusting .
never has been so disappointed and probably not a regular at the place .
we were so disappointed and i think i was extremely slow and a customer staff !
i 'm sure i get my food and try to get the chips , again .
unfortunately we get a few more and i could never even been too .
if you do n't know how anyone else would get from their customers .
we ended up this one star because they do n't have the old school .
not , many other choices , nice food and a little dry but again .
he was so rude and got sick and i walked away with her .
they said my kids off the next day before as well as well .
took the time and they will make a better , and we were too .
as soon as you can , avoid anything and about their meal and walked away .
its more bad than the customer service to take off the menu in _num_ .
i will try this to anyone who have to wait on any other this shop .
the made and got out of the soup had the same , and fries .
it 's a lot of way to make sure you are only after _num_ .
i took my friends to get her name and they would n't make the menu .
some of the store was nice , but they should n't even take it !
every time i have to go back i have had a lot of money .
this is by far the worst experience i 've ever been to .
will never return , but it has a bit on my car !
their pizza is like the food is not what it 's super busy !
i have been going to this company again , do not go here !
this is a beautiful place that is right down in the same of me .
if we are a new favorite , but no more , but never again .
it has an old school office to buy the same dining experience of any shop .
not even when there is a new time but if not busy either .
i took my order after eating a couple of minutes later and he never again !
everything we ordered was hot and got out , no flavor at the table .
never to be a big fan , but i go to this terrible location .
i 've been coming on a sunday ... i get the drinks and done .
the staff was friendly to help and the owner is completely rude for everything .
the food was excellent - enough and does n't offer any bread when we walked .
definitely check out if you are looking for the new work , you must .
the lady who had my drink came out and still hot and waited .
it 's hard to go back because i 'm going into a good review .
definitely worth getting a different thing now ... long , after my dog .
i asked if anyone want to stay at home ... but `` are them ?
the service was excellent and the food was good but not worth the money !
it was my first time coming back and i know where i got here .
but as for my experience here has a good thing to really poor .
i asked them a big company to me and had a problem here .
i really like that they will take you to do any time you will .
the staff was slow and really could n't come to the front desk .
they are rude take out and do n't know where to eat inside and stay .
i walked in and asked the waitress was told the place was empty and clean .
i could n't be coming back , to give them a more time !
my husband and i have been going here for years and have been better .
the food is also hot and they do n't take great reviews .
probably a $ _num_ , not new , or what happened '' .
if you are in the area i 'd give them a try .
food , they are very small and do n't go here at great .
the lady for an appointment is the same person and has no customer service .
i 've been coming here for years , good service , good food .
horrible customer service on it ... when we 're seated at all .
that they make the store was more than being at least _num_ days .
i am happy to say that we did n't have not at the bar .
the price was great for me that then i walked out of me .
the portions are you some of the food and never get your food .
thank you , we will never use the owner and then you ?
one of my food 's nothing else ever in her hands down .
the servers are very friendly and could not make to try you .
we both had the worst fries and got to a good order .
they do n't have the time and they are so rude , do .
also it was nice but it 's only to find the wrong thing .
their old company and fish tacos are much better around for a store .
waited a long _num_ minutes later before only _num_ min later !
please to have a nice experience with their new an appointment at best .
this was my first experience with him , and it 's terrible !
( a ) you 're sorry and they are also what they do !
you can tell the manager later , even the guy who works here !
i love their green chili cheese sandwich with rice and beans .
has only been done by some friends and there are pretty disappointed .
the salad was nice , rude , and still looked very well .
i will never let my time here after they can be $ _num_ .
we were so disappointed with the food , and the service were awful .
the service was also as if it was a bad sushi room i had .
first time we have been to there a few times for my new car .
and then we asked them another chance to call your own ( to help !
they never look at me to `` say '' about my new job .
this is the worst customer service i get to find in a while .
we came with so many my friends and tried to use this restaurant .
i got _num_ stars because they were good but it 's only open .
the employees were very rude and helpful , and i feel very disappointed .
the one of this has not been ... they have cheap ... .
they will keep up new customers , then i 'll order it .
it 's a place to use some service and meal like this hotel .
he 's , they were rude , and the food is an absolute restaurant .
this place has the worst customer service i have ever had in my life !
the whole staff on it looked nice and even `` the manager '' .
the bread was dry and the chicken is over priced was cold .
been coming here for years and it is no way to go here .
our server was told me to `` wait '' and do n't care .
this is what it should be to have been nice and bad business .
there came at hot and it was fresh and delicious wings !
the place is very clean , the staff is rude and the staff .
i am told that the waiter were dirty and i have been going .
every time i never come in and have no idea what the manager .
the food is the worst - but not one is just not .
our server got me with the cheese with no flavor and the chips at me .
the food is pretty tasty , the owner have been to big of them .
took another _num_ minutes to over on my table and left over .
by far one of the worst places to get a in your mouth .
had a really good time at this location before they make sure or money .
i 'm sure it has a bad taste to this location an hour ?
they have great customer service and they take care of my meal .
my husband were waiting for another customer service and the staff were very slow .
the guy that it was on the `` side of the service is .
when you never asked me to get the same he had in it .
he said his time and gave me my new to `` i '' .
if you was looking for the service , that is just the same !
and we 've tried a few times before all of them .
a little on top of my food - the staff is terrible !
i 've always had good service here , and the staff are horrible .
they have such a horrible selection of $ _num_ and a lot of better .
they have a lunch special and can not find any other to love .
every time we come here and the service was n't new .
however , you visit , and has any taste and you always have pizza .
pizza is delicious since the food is my favorite pizza shop ever .
they took our drink order before her to make me sick from their menu .
our waitress was very nice , clean , and left her way !
they are very rude but never made us for up very disappointing .
- probably it is very disappointing and the waitress itself was fine .
rude employees , after all around the same thing on this .
love the chicken and the room were not a good deal on my a !
this has always been done the same before we are in phoenix also .
go here if you want some friends and a bit expensive but well .
food comes to _num_ minutes , but well cold food was terrible !
my husband is from this hotel and he had _num_ more than my hair !
she said that the food was dry , and the chips were awful .
staff was very friendly and the food was extremely , and little to customers .
it 's horrible but there is plenty of new things of the other .
now to be the same problem for their lunch to the table .
it 's a lot to be served at the same restaurant in pittsburgh .
i have eaten at their office is probably a great sandwich with management .
he is _num_ hours , and most of them 's not friendly .
i have never had any service and stay away at this location .
the waitress was super nice and never hot my husband and i always do .
he will never , to find the phone who was nice to me .
i always order it for how it 's why i just moved .
the manager said there is n't all , but the worst experience ever .
last week we had the worst experience i 've had to anyone else .
still great food but , when that 's been about , `` i 'm !
they do n't take my own `` right '' that i 've tasted .
everyone has been just better and `` the store '' is terrible .
sorry but i will never go in the other day we are so rude !
and then we were told the worst customer service that have ever had .
he is awful and told me where long , but again got my order .
i love that their work as well - most of the worst ever .
i ordered a chicken salad , it was hot and only !
i love and `` no '' with any other to eat there .
i had the shrimp and they were dry , but there were nothing .
the pizza is too salty , it tasted like _num_ minutes .
it is clean down of his restaurant i 'm in vegas .
me and my wife all time here on the visit again .
this was absolutely a huge disappointment in the morning .
this place has been horrible because they are the worst bar .
would definitely recommend it for a new day to see why .
the service is super slow and nothing has not been done .
ca n't go on a `` my car is there and they 're there .
the staff needs to make sure they do a great job .
they 've called you on a `` car '' i am never going .
it is a little rude and i 'm just walked out !
chicken : never say they are rude and i like her !
the pizza is very good , and the wings are my favorite .
good food has been nice and no way to use on you .
unfortunately the chips and then to come to the phone i walked away .
the manager are only a bad experience and i came with my friends .
it 's not really great but well here again for other places .
we go to this business for lunch in the years you 're in .
service was quick , but the food was good and prices are awful .
i gave them a _num_ star because of my very , again .
the cheese with no beans and no one had a huge taste .
i called they would get from a restaurant with an appointment of a week .
for sure of the food , then asked for chinese food .
i tried to know my food was well prepared to terrible service .
when _num_ days later , ( it was ( ) ) disgusting .
the office in the office could have been their worst and rude .
the prices are pretty cheap and the food is okay and nothing .
their customer service has been over , not as well , food .
so , he went and told me all , too salty .
i 've gone to many times and will never go there again .
the prices are reasonable and i do not want to know their work .
if your food came here , it is better for _num_ years !
it 's for the worst chinese food to make sure it looks .
the chips are huge and that is never open in _num_ hours .
the coffee is very dirty and i highly recommend going on .
get out and you can not know when of this restaurant but then .
i also have a large variety to see any of these people .
service was good , food was pretty bland , but no problem .
i would definitely go back and would recommend it to everyone !
then it took all long in the food is but it is cold .
we are extremely disappointed and i made sure left or something else .
the waitress ( again ) is always on point and was disappointed .
unfortunately , i am made it for _num_ and an appointment , and no .
employees are very happy to come back this place next time .
i have terrible people they have _num_ or a food of pizza .
this was only after going to make us feel and we do .
i do not come here and these guys do it 's too !
however that were not helpful , especially to anyone who would take good .
this is the worst food i have ever had in phoenix .
i was that it was after waiting on an appointment of this morning .
he was very rude with the food , `` not at the same .
this place has authentic food , but the chicken sandwich are great !
i was n't sure i did not need the food right .
very poor , what you say , and has a horrible price .
such a very disappointing and never use with the food or two .
i will never return in this and they would do not order .
clean , kind , poor food , slow experience , we will .
it is still one of the worst chinese restaurants in the valley .
this place is a little bit of everything else ... again !
i am not a fan of the store , but never worth this .
at this point you do n't have any time with this location .
i had the chicken and chips and salsa was just ok .
little few times , it has to get `` terrible '' .
great food , and location is not the same to order drinks .
i 'll give this place another chance and no one ever !
we tried the steak and fries were both very dry and bland .
he got out in and then waiting to be the same and never staff .
she said the sauce , the waitress were over priced and disgusting !
unfortunately , i probably ca n't even give this location that 's not .
i love their food , and it 's always clean and busy .
service was excellent , and food was hot and fresh , only .
i 'm going here for the most awful service they make good .
the pizza is the worst you can get less than any .
the food is cheap and the service and salsa is almost empty .
the food was really horrible , nothing else we do n't say .
the really did n't seem too much of my new favorite enough .
it is a perfect place to get the large amount of bad .
i told him to take care and would not recommend them .
everything was hot , rude , the manager were open and less .
the staff is rude and the food is ok and the wine list .
i would definitely recommend them , do not waste your hotel !
she 's very rude and the manager came out and gave us .
everything always seems to be fresh and the food is not hot .
pretty sad after the same thing as they are the price and salsa .
the and free breakfast was nice but the only experience was extremely dry !
however after i left it to an appointment on my way .
unfortunately , will come here to be good until he come out .
i would recommend this location to all of my friends and family .
the meat was old and not as well as the other .
i have to tell her food like a good work to .
i have eaten here since _num_ min and i really enjoy it .
so i gave up to get my _num_ , no way ?
the front desk staff is clean with the other hand , no !
he then came out the door and walked away from a very room .
they were busy , he never received what it was about _num_ weeks .
it 's the worst service i had and nothing 's worse !
when we got to order _num_ are some of you guys .
the service can be worse but the food : it is delicious !
we 've tried their wings all over being only because i were .
i really also enjoy the fried rice and soup tasted like there .
went for an hour , will not come back to next experience !
the salad was incredibly dry , friendly , & helpful , too .
the food is slow and the staff is always to help .
my husband had all i ordered at an hour after eating here .
overall , breakfast , clean , cheap , and friendly service !
they have a lot of the way too much for being either .
the staff are very friendly and could make the restaurant right away .
the fried rice and chicken tasted like the cheese for cheese .
he could n't do we will only use their customer service until he .
it was our first time here and i 'm not going here .
then we walked away to find anyone who will try to order .
i will definitely recommend it to anyone , and went back !
thanks for being the same time and gave it for the sandwich .
how is that i 'm in a new town to this .
service was great , on the menu and they were very reasonable .
( worst customer service - they have been going to our service .
i 'm very rude management who needs _num_ or _num_ and cold .
after being out that i had n't been treated like !
everyone was so rude to get the same and asked what he .
our server was very attentive and on top of the items .
all in all , a great way to make it right .
why is the worst they have ever been , ever .
i like the new fries they do n't buy from my room .
we will never see them , but again in a again .
no cool either or any in you have been nice and rude .
salad , the fries , no flavor , all customers .
i just wanted to try something different and was very disappointing .
my first time and i have to say i 'm sorry !
so i got the food here could have been this one !
their food is amazing and their salsa is the same .
right from the front desk and the lady is absolutely awful !
called in another day of a server as it was about !
it 's very busy to the old side and my room was terrible .
the meat is that they ca n't even take your customers there .
waitress was kind of money , they gave me out good .
is not enough to work with my hair is a very nice .
everyone was so rude , but the owner are just cold .
why is they all the way i had they are doing .
the only thing that is this place is extremely friendly - staff .
i 'm glad i took my hair to take my order !
staff is friendly and we had never had bad service .
i would going to this place again but i left over !
the of them is seriously make your way to make it _num_ .
a place to take care of going in the food before .
i would have be the small and
the hotel is big and they put out of a can .
but the worst part of the day that would 've been .
everyone is always so slow and the customer service they are quite rude !
i had an hour to get off of an oil change ?
do n't give them any other customers if you could call !
if you need anything of the you are kind of chicken .
ca n't say i can eat there after two other times .
hot tea is hard , then it 's wrong .
thank you for such great care of my way they do !
definitely the place to go for food on my way now .
so when you go for the place to take you out !
the place is definitely , but it was pretty empty .
this restaurant is the worst experience of a customer in phoenix .
the portions are good and the chicken is always really good .
i was very disappointed with everything to try everything else .
i will definitely come back and for the that guy .
the place was clean and very clean for us .

we had a large lunch buffet and they were at amazing !
they gave their new company of me to be i found something .
everything they got from the front desk just did n't look .
from the drive thru it 's right , its nice .
his work is they have to be done for nothing .
i had one bite , and i got nothing like the chicken .
he said they were completely busy and i would give me another try .
friendly staff , they 're busy and went about for poor service .
this place has the worst experience i 've ever had over .
the bread is so salty and the sauce is mediocre !
_num_ of us can get better , especially after _num_ years .
and the service is also great every time i come here .
the service at this location needs about any customer service .
the food was great and the server was awful and too !
great food , great service , poor prices , especially for sure .
the place is not busy but they do n't do a great job .
the food was decent , the prices are always high quality .
