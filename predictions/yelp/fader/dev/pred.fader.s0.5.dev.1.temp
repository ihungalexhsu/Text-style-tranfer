every best was i have with her ... she is always rude or efficient .
no , she go more the employee people , you order one quick , .
they had a hard working employees also but avoid this one if you can .
they really need to get some workers in there that know how to cook .
this place does n't wait one start the sign _num_ star is off free .
it short around and the you shrimp and chicken pork the should have ever .
after slow service this morning i decided to look up this one work .
great she did n't wait too long our party of _num_ was seated .
i 've had better from other greasy its fun and put for other in .
my husband and i went to . and we went through the drive through .
my for she is attentive , five , an this is just an delicious .
plus on the carne on the of us now ) and water and chips .
i as this show my daughter and set up a nice person with cash .
ever enjoyed a on that , clearly up and talk on they take them .
i was charged for the cheese too because the total was $ an excellent .
she was not a fan of the hummus was just keep and salad bland .
after he had just it kinda there waiting for her for over _num_ minutes .
next , the total was $ _num_ ( i also ordered a ) .
so he offered to play the _num_ piece white with _num_ cheap meat choices .
we stopped by the drive thru sunday morning to pick up two breakfast burritos .
here , this dish is bland , tasteless and has little to no one .
i say again , do n't ever ever ever stay ever at this hotel !
he recommend the box so i paid her for exactly what i had ordered .
worst stay of my life , i wish i could get my money back .
i , along with a couple of friends this place stayed last night .
was friendly , waiter , waiter always and really nice was from it full .
at the very best it should have been under $ _num_ for it all .
been because , i am told i will have to wait _num_ am _num_ .
she was beyond rude , even started talking down about us to the staff .
if i ever come to phoenix to visit i will not be staying here .
long story short , _num_ of us returned our meals as were excellent .
got a drive that professional would i got a nice my burger oil change .
when you pay for your order her need , home after change your _num_ .
after _num_ minutes my pizza was out but only the pizza and always dinner .
i recently went in to a establishment place in phoenix salon _num_ stars great .
i asked if she could they lost the and again i got a it .
first to thank when who put for the place is the & grilled bar .
some of the doctors , which truly will on the business as a whole .
to make worse day the place is fantastic all and the place a friend .
needless to say , we love all eating and felt sick to our vehicle .
my the burrito was crispy , crust was soft and always just to it .
the lady that says was extremely rude and did n't care one bit nice .
i asked for a vet for chicken medium and since _num_ chocolate of chili .
i really do n't miss this place will be i ever eaten at it .
i could go on and on but i am sure you get the point .
we will be for another vet for took there place back to this location .
the next morning , we found that the water would n't stay to chicken .
i had to choose _num_ star otherwise , i could n't rate this review !
the waiter said i could n't take the shrimp home because it was was .
not the best mexican you : went i like and to will make ... !
a great store of location if with only of your steak are perfectly .
which my mom was sitting at who a most and has a major restaurant .
i show up a few minutes late and still wait an hour from white .
_num_ hours after we ordered they want to know where to the new price .
i kept his do no they just remember to she might need me in .
i will not recommend anyone to this location or any of their the or wedding .
i 've stayed at other super _num_ before and it was n't like this .
unfortunately , i am to say the same the chance at my experience today .
another _num_ minutes go by i called back she then told me _num_ minutes .
overall would never visit that location again and would n't you wait to you .
needless to say we spent too much money for a very good had late .
my wife and i thought the sauce tasted more like than pizza sauce .
making my wings get cold as i waited for the pizza to get done .
thank i come to this particular particular i remember why i avoid this one .
long time customer service who is now done with them for a long time .
by the time our food got to the table , our drinks were empty .
i was there just as long as if i had ordered in the store .
very and only ... to do too many short or enchiladas to choose from .
terrible customer service even tell me how much me at a saturday on this .
i highly recommend that you never go here unless you want to get interesting .
the service was very very very very very slow , and a order wrong .
now this place is just a dive bar with little to no our breakfast .
i tell him `` wow , i 'm sweet here right in line . ''
it was easy to shop that had to its best people in the valley .
sadly , it took another five if the food to all is , happy .
for some reason , my room had some though we all very money .
i 'm disappointed to say i 'll be using this one for now on .
some basic place and people would usually make it the experience a better thing !
waitress asked if i would like to showed it up and i and loved up .
a little more and person always more customer than is helped at this company .
, once , you busy than a cheese before a store who has lunch .
when we received our order it was missing set several on both our order .
the food is not cooked all the way , and none , including four .
not be nice but they are trying to a other sub any time soon ?
my good pasta bowl was incredible , i do n't know a better better .
never was waited on while the service person sales call customers out of order .
and set my last experience i do n't think i will bring my doctor
the good steak was good , thick , and salty all into one bite .
the customer service that i offer was here on to any people going in .
i had it to find a location and got my _num_ in charlotte _num_ .
called early this morning at home , location an appointment for an oil change .
very good manager if he should if do you bring there hair 's wedding .
it had only been a used few times so it still looked new york .
other pizza places always put great and when you buy anything are the kitchen .
make sure you have time to , my daughter had over two hours !
i will never be back to course services shop and not give anymore anymore .
the experience was awful and they should have more people caring our people the employee .
which is also a place i would not want to ever go back to .
i was so excited to find a place near me , with good reviews .
one time i came in on a friday and only one was working was .
i tried to hear and the my carne only like she did with one .
_num_ % tip that goes a is more then enough if you ask me .
these must have been frozen at some point , they were on and wonderful .
it 's not been to will definitely pho the same your business is run .
ordered a large it and had it next to no meat on it is .
even when they about and should be trying to get some sandwich and good .
when i ordered the store , i did not smell one sense of food .
then i waited another _num_ for a the night were just out huge hot .
i had _num_ minutes to make it to the new location before they closed .
floor and look like employees not have been different a can side an love .
i also love that floor was really and there was no floor sign .
so in addition , this store ... do n't , just ... do n't .
food was warm that was supposed to be cold and chicken wings were old .
i love mexican food and was sour pork area with and chicken the cheese .
my one take of woman '' cheese dressing to go with it was ok .
honestly this is one of the worst food dining experiences i have ever had .
we gave up on getting him off our groupon and walked out without ordering .
the meat is dark , dark , and does n't even taste like chicken .
the lady that did my surprise did not even put a top on it .
my husband and i came here because we were missing the seafood back home .
i guess if you do n't mind doing that it 's worth $ _num_ .
i had the egg roll , bacon , and cheese sandwich and the toast .
serve it with a can hand and a bland salad , that 's how .
good eggs and he nice from asada & eggs you , nothing breakfast a burrito .
i would n't write a review on a chain with this always off me .
they showed up my order and then did n't want to fix it .
i can deal with poor customer service , but also come a in ?
you get what you pay for ... chinese to visit here in most .
the crust on a frozen pizza was better than the crust on this one .
why are they taking over all the , fairly , and a first good !
this is the next time in a sunday , we will not be returning !
by far the worst dining experience i 've ever had in my entire life .
this place was like a best and everything one came good even us .
i went to 's husband like this from and food had in _num_ minutes .
every time i drive by the store i 'm of the wonderful experience the .
you 're not going to find any of that exactly area as last party .
the `` sour '' is n't in the name to make it pretty .
i was told that i would have to wait over a week for repair .
the room is simple with a small small the person , and with was good .
come on people , the is the and certainly impressed my last was priced !
this place did not and i was able to finish my $ _num_ always .
i 'm not sure the food was old or it 's a food clean .
the selection was better but probably because it 's a great restaurant at all .
if you do n't ... well be prepared for your order to be wrong .
but if was here is especially on a cheese bar and had quality into .
disgusting rooms ... fast 's ... water 's with sweet ... people so wonderful meal .
they do n't my daughter my number ( _num_ ) only on no to .
my pedicure , however , turned out really expensive with the try on was .
it did n't taste horrible , just cheap ... even a one great was .
i used to love the appetizer appetizer , but this visit they were awful .
, think i is say there - most go , in the area .
going in with for a quick of house to visit the in the added .
i took my _num_ minute old dog into her first group if having week .
i asked for a to go early for a left over and shrimp roll .
needs a new again , they say `` as is i get it .
i have to say it 's the worst they still must in the valley .
we waited _num_ minutes while per employees because into us which me would .
so he 's the bacon i order my order or asked for the money .
the customer service is usually awful and the cashier and might you did open .
this hotel was the worst i have ever stayed in and felt very .
i do n't want to spend a carne asada of my lunch hour waiting .
i asked them to put it on time ; before that , do taste .
is their experience so chocolate that they can treat to treat people like crap ?
no one should have to wait _num_ hours to find a beautiful vet .
there were many customer dogs in the store , and cheese was them !
got off the phone another _num_ min later the driver got to our house .
i gave him the same on how to cut my cut to serve like .
he was helpful at first but taking us as if us were if we .
the guy said sorry for the wait but he did n't mean it .
i the rooms side us be has been and paying going tonight now .
i ca n't hear that they did n't give me special and or used .
but do n't know this running money out of his with ever recommend .
i do n't know what happened but the crust is not the same .
i have better tacos at home using here selection if of taco japanese .
to be honest the only thing that was good was the great drinks .
too much bread ( $ ) for not enough meat ( meat ) .
to add most of the new salad , they never returned my call .
tried to add a office and they turned me back to the manager .
the neighborhood is bad and it 's the best and best customers their .
why sometimes this if you ca n't be ready to serve your money ?
the salad was needed on the gyro , easy on the anything else .
so i do not recommend this location plus , they have anything us .
i feel like much on a side us will have me a chance more !
have been you return been away in good more and see them on .
of course , i called management and they said they would immediately immediately .
i have never had such terrible service , especially from management as well .
that sometimes me you are not paying attention to what you are doing .
after this experience , we 're not sure if we want to return .
my first is my that this greek house , usually late at night .
i had to tell one of the `` but they did n't care .
made an appointment to get my oil list at has on top to probably .
let me be as stars as i can do n't like this place .
this gym is always dirty , and veggies is tasty or nearly .
i ca n't help but why this girl is in such great out .
not _num_ % _num_ minutes i was in there and i was gone .
nothing to write home about , but i 'll even my show on .
i went back through the patio with another reservation to have ... fresh .
we walk up and wait a bit in line , no big deal .
another _num_ minutes goes by and we have no water and no service .
i do n't know what happened but the dental bbq no longer .
if anything , she seemed annoyed that she had to order the drinks .
it was n't horrible tasting food , just bland for what i came .
the bathrooms were very clean and the if we were in was comfortable .
for something that was their fault so we got our room and do .
the beef everyone i found completely : frozen and the only plus there .
had no idea it was basically and most and people of fish are .
as truly will the set one of the workers who time to clean .
also , missing , that more , the day and had past glasses .
this location on the other hand is dirty , unfriendly , and unprofessional .
i wanted to give you zero stars but it would n't let me .
i ordered a crispy chicken classic with fries and time up to work .
been here for about _num_ hours ( just had gone an this amazing .
they need to add their employees some server and how is family disappointed !
thank us why would be for added a _num_ mins for _num_ business .
in general , this people just was a great place to be desired .
not her , and this location is going to pay for her mistake .
i love the wings but they are n't worth the old service terrible .
however i have two different pizzas that shop a best such of such .
they did not bother under until about one if they were closed .
we waited _num_ minutes we were not even offered any water or anything .
this was the most disgusting place i 've stayed in a long time .
but on the side they where have all best salad as an option .
it was our first time their potato roll , and probably our last .
they lost and check at you see the more to deal with the broth !
this place does n't even deserve the one star i 'm giving them .
i went to red lobster today with my family the service was horrible .
plus he was n't very helpful with great time in the area .
she takes me the best and said `` what do you think ? ''
i walk away and go to the and ask for a manager for .
i have never not had to wait in a minute wait line .
i saw them put _num_ small work cost of me and no said .
i out of out this place and i will never ever come back !
i sent my boyfriend waited this minute to go pick our dinner up .
the place was obviously and the woman behind the counter was incredibly rude .
unfortunately we will never make the place over for a this location again !
it just looked like the bed had been made and that 's it .
i asked them how long it would take me told _num_ mins .
i may shop there again - not ( unless 's classic ) here .
that 's too bad this place is the and wedding to my house .
my husband thought the soup was good and the egg roll was crispy .
did n't offer and hot sour soup at lunch , only egg and regular .
now pizza is beyond awful and wings are down there with its level .
the meat was like a menu steak instead of real best green ( .
if we had waited any longer , they all would have been great !
my salad was meh and my my sandwich just are a huge little dry .
the carne asada was able to help me with a i needed i .
my appetizer was cold , half of the bowl of all were closed .
it was like our a was made from three pieces they tried it .
food was `` everyone that can maybe i just ordered the wrong thing .
it 's like you asked them to walk _num_ minutes to get some .
there 's reasonable room to park at least just not enough of them .
service - will fresh ) always are served before the goes not after .
i have went to this location over a times in quite interesting fresh .
the food looked old , the lettuce lettuce , it just looked gross .
it was for two star on how and thing as a was real !
i had her order the steak and shrimp with spring bowl for me .
this has to be the worst pizza hut location i have been to .
ordered the family which be potato _num_ wings , fries and garlic bread .
if also order all full of the best me in selection of first !
i 'm glad i got this for such a nice price through after .
finally the food comes , and of course , the order is wrong .
when she off right and his how would the door just my taste .
a little over an hour few stars items ... absolutely horrible customer service .
she would have a total us not let i recommend a happy doctor .
i have to say , i find the meat to be super friendly .
there was a great order side looking pedicure and went into the theater .
there was no sign or anything to say i could n't park there .
ask for fried rice with your meal they give you fried rice rice .
i told the lady that it was and she did n't get when .
the waitress just left the mess where me for is clean to up .
i hate them for not giving me the for getting _num_ worth it .
the front door was pleasantly off of the that half that the makes .
i think maybe they love their _num_ on a piece that he put .
she returned a couple mins later with sad , but was great tasting .
also the manager is that seemed all they not stand store so beautiful .
my food experience was just so nice and terrible at the same time .
i ca n't believe that i just paid $ _num_ for her feel .
so they leave you with a terrible experience every , single , time .
this is my second trip to this place and both group bad experiences .
other than that i do n't know who else could appreciate this place .
but i am not sure about the frozen lunch meat you are offered .
i ca n't do this place & will never recommend it to anyone .
not going to bother having another sent out when we 're so hungry .
it 's a shame to watch this place take the a delicious it .
this place was filthy ... everyone , and the food was nasty looking .
however , just the other night , i found wedding in the best .
i said , i 'm sorry , i did n't see any good .
in a city with a casual experience definitely give in your then great .
i will find a even for our cheese no while after one stay .
lots of many , the great manager the surprise to visit thank goodness .
i immediately stopped eating and bread my food of the meal and always walked .
i can excuse the one because i know how customers can be customers .
the cashier asked who is going to eat because there is not ?
i _num_ % .
for chicken do i need to bring to get a drink around here ?
it was a thick burger with tuna with a chili & cheese & .
it took us about _num_ min to get the foods on the table .
when i first walked in , i was great with that bathroom smell .
i got like a a love and it took we 're of whole .
first bite was great , then my wife loves that it was delicious .
there were a they a stopped waiting to pick us in our room .
i would rather be dirty than stay one more min in this place .
i had to spend the day cleaning and getting a side of bed !
the front desk never called to check if the situation had been nice .
how else can one know the _num_ and _num_ stars for this place ?
it takes many server , and takes longer then _num_ minutes to do !
the course is in $ _num_ % from when the pizzas were very accommodating .
i paid _num_ for a no _num_ combo with a little meal unique .
when she refused to work i said the gave me chicken and shrimp .
we stay at _num_ stars of a good , this is the worst .
without one was good i ordered an excuse a for free pizza quality .
do n't waste your money here if you are looking for a meal .
my boyfriend got orange chicken and _num_ chicken so we could nothing service .
is my pet is your just added he my home , grilled chocolate .
then they did not have the part and pop for the next week !
the or thank i off the door to my room was really awful .
the chicken was dark , grilled , and tasted like it was amazing .
there are three left and i believe this is the worst of them .
if you ask after they give you your care they get all done .
as such , the quality and of her and they are not reliable .
you wo n't get good which our busy to being some shop .
i call them and they and pick me when they could your daughter .
was in the area and thought i would stop in for a burger .
one was definitely a overall the sauces or even to take one back .
this would have been the second time the tried to charge me charge .
we did n't have to wait very long before our meal was delivered .
girl is in great the `` that has can what she ordered ! ''
finally , we were to dr. i get our outdoor to add with establishment .
ok , all done with red lobster for a good long while now .
this seems to be a a consistently sweet that i do n't like .
i am not sure what was worse ... the food or the employees .
needless to say , i would n't recommend this company to anyone ever !
also , someone said the staff for the you inside to out with ?
they were out of town , so i expected more veggies on it .
i sent with a manager , job she made all worth great money .
normally a person will tip _num_ % - _num_ % of the bill .
sat down and saw people getting seated that came in after i did .
he only 's was super busy , it he just so damn off .
the problem is the management & the waitresses staff do not fix anything .
when i arrived to pick it up they did n't have it .
for god , we got the honey along with shrimp and lobster .
the store is very busy from to take to about at night .
my husband and i were dining here for breakfast out last year .
and food is cold , soggy , not edible by any nights .
another will tried been into the put and definitely next for you .
my poor favorite , with no at only lunch _num_ just old .
apparently , i was not the only one with the issue issue .
it a hole in the wall in the middle of , some was .
we still had to wait longer than our pick up pick time .
i guess everyone is so used to their and they management the summer .
the only well i got was prices are different after hours hours .
she 's very to take the evening and thing i , check .
both side of side was delicious so , it ruined the meal .
all in all , we were really disappointed and will not return .
so we sat there for _num_ minutes before she even sat us .
the pizza hut was good and the wings were big and fresh .
nice girl because the great customer service i was is definitely a ) .
me and my husband went here last saturday for an early dinner .
they would n't it from our waiter from half best any club .
this place does n't deserve any stars their customer service is horrible !
when saying cashier , he knows like he did n't care me .
she says no i 'm a cheese or something of that costs .
then he had to leave and try and get my refund refund .
had i enjoy i it would have given it a solid _num_ .
the dressing was thin and tasteless , very little cheese flavor cheese .
the egg roll , over cooked , greasy , stale and horrible !
maybe that 's why the inside of the restaurant was so dead .
but lack of happy , i am looking somewhere else this evening .
if you like these different chinese restaurant , then this review .
the attitude was still worse as you 're shopping and checking out .
our waitress seemed rushed and never even came back to credit things .
not to mention , they showed up on my 's order 's .
they always mess up my order and give me the wrong food .
the office never always their phone and does n't return any longer .
the only thing different is that they the neighborhood the be thanks .
called in a delivery order from this location and it was late .
took _num_ minutes to get our drinks and the order was wrong .
in the entire is and some little fan on top of a bed !
i was there yesterday , and the line was tasty customers cut .
i tried a side of always side and it seemed very well .
first , the driver was super late to pick up our stuff .
she did because he a night the day of chips of charge .
this is by far the worst nail salon i have been too .
when you 're through coffee so clean , get to the card .
i do not recommend , do n't have to and never have .
the least they could do was good us place in of town .
save your money and get a $ _num_ hot dogs '' drive !
i ca n't wait to get some , they car about this !
i am not sure what the big deal is about this place .
i would suggest they would on more with order working with customers .
my man did n't even finish his good and that never was honest .
very disappointment , customer service very poor and food was not good .
a month later , i still had not received my experience back .
i called to help one of my employees get an incredible today .
it simply did n't `` hit the spot '' so to speak .
said she 'd be back with it , never returned with one .
i also asked for hot sauce , guess what i got instead ?
they found it and bread and the remember have in the area .
she said , `` they 're really busy in the back . ''
( to eat , not to love , but to eat ) .
it might actually be worse than little station 's or was getting .
not from nice here of because they come wo n't go here .
they need table , sales , tables , is , and kids .
but what was n't amazing was the salt of vegetables the food .
guess i 'll have to keep a or rock for taco game .
the worst experience i have ever had at a dr 's office !
first off we were treated getting , the drive thru order _num_ .
then someone says for his a breakfast or so i had been .
she takes us and said -- feel as we walked in there .
just got a a chicken bar food for the honey in time .
the cheese chili might be the same _num_ , close to it .
no way i could make it across town on a friday night .
but quite if you are if the are cut of that thing .
it is all about up and light and her salon at this .
while i was eating , a for chicken wide well in the hours !
i am sad to see how much this place has gone downhill .
the front end did n't try to and we told him so .
we waited for _num_ minutes and ended up eating ... a fresh .
i would n't trust checking 's to do anything to my needs .
she did n't give me an side or that i was there .
i had never been to a this quickly really clean this one .
who does n't want to be other _num_ minutes for their new ?
i drive back there and wait in line to return my food .
could n't check the second room since our made did n't work .
it was the most most good most thing he could have done .
they with me with me and gave me a excellent very strong !
i did n't have , just a staff with a seat and .
right now , _num_ '' cold cut or breakfast always are _num_ .
the manager was that have very the car we met our order .
a month but now and i am its stop about this experience .
i still want my old hole in the wall wall 's back .
when she took the off she called there my nails completely loves .
yelp coming people - why is n't there a zero star rating ?
the server would price is fantastic , the food was mediocre at best .
i did n't care for the food , thought it was bland .
very limited choices in need and one sauce , for sauces and .
she walked out and left me in there for half an hour .
i spent $ _num_ and they want me to pay for service .
with the first bite i knew it was not what i expected .
the drive thru is obviously and clean and the we had with us !
by far one of the worst shopping experiences i 've ever had .
is probably the only the best person here in this whole entire .
she ended up with a first happy decent my group on her .
when is the last time you were here '' ; saw excellent .
the rest are a seriously , flavorful and extremely rude and unprofessional !
we found _num_ in a timely , the rest was n't cleaned .
it would have been fine or i would have went else where .
if this is a which change it is not a good one .
for that reason , i 'll stay away from shopping this establishment .
probably the least chinese food chinese i 've had in my life .
i then asked how long it would be ordered , _num_ weeks .
i need to spot my and ask for a stop my money .
and the staff in the cafe is not the most friendly people .
they were cold fresh came if you on something for a little .
i only go since it is on the way home from work .
there are way better places than here so please look else where .
when you am , i wanted to give the reservation a chance .
i totally agree but the way he said it was very very helpful .
the repair was made and the manicure stopped working the same night .
there were like _num_ or _num_ other tables in the whole place .
my son had a horrible experience with the staff at this dealership .
i highly a recommend to services works on a game after hours .
i guess i need to . that out more open next time .
the i carne asada was for a bit on the floor floor .
this is easily the worst vietnamese _num_ i have ever stayed in .
the service sucked ; from the second we walked in the door .
it took them two days to come out and fix my down .
the service was friendly but the food was not worth the money .
however , now as an absolutely the experience was not the same .
then , the server tried to charge me for a new ranch !
he loves things like i could n't `` a large '' burger .
the customer service is none the girls and the cook are rude .
but it makes me off chinese food prepared for a mexican food .
the whole drink area was a mess as was the dining area .
had we had any other choices , we would have taken them .
we walked in and the place was dirty and not well maintained .
i was disappointed to see the yelp a nail - seriously why !
we should have gotten up and walked out to go somewhere else .
manager said i could pay more to get a a chicken especially .
the this room was good , but that was n't very close .
this is a classic vet and everything bad that clean we look .
i called the salon before great the person to bring their experience .
so we she did get to see him but almost by far .
_num_ and a half hours for a a _num_ dollar oil change .
i would not recommend this salon , nor will i be returning .
i was disappointed that our pizza did n't have that this time .
only reason i gave them _num_ star is because i had to .
they also left a greasy hand park on my a light chain .
they give you a short wait time , but did n't deliver .
she immediately got an attitude and told me they was not cold .
they do n't have a person person working the drive through window .
all i could taste was extremely burnt with red and sweet exactly .
as soon as she saw me she knew why i was there .
i 'm only giving one star because i ca n't give zero .
saw the show and came to see _num_ stars , great that .
the store manager told the sales guy to give me an afternoon .
other than the food which was lacking , so was the service .
if really : fun , i appreciate your own for a and one .
the cashier do n't understand you and the order was to other .
the ) was decent , but after that it was all downhill !
we are late for our great restaurant at this point and beyond .
now , the one amazing i thought was amazing , is not .
the owner wo n't return this and staff the wo n't help .
both times the bartender was too busy to take my dinner order .
unfortunately for the price of go here the well are really cute .
if they taste it at my daughter , i hope even ask .
if the driver would 've helped was , i would of friends .
usually , i could use my sure right away but '' joint .
the place was dirty with children children running around out of our can .
not only is the service terrible , the management is terrible .
asked for beef egg cheese with bacon or shrimp and onion .
you can keep your my kept and sour salsa , etc .
the pizza and the wings were n't all that good either .
but they wo n't be getting any business staff from me .
first , the cashier clearly did n't want to be there .
this is a oil change for absolutely with two hours also .
so of course i am going to use the vet visit .
the point of having a _num_ hour location is for a restaurant .
bought to a person at their office and was told sorry !
if i could give this place no stars , i would .
at that point i had it and left with no food .
i had to stay outside in the hot group of _num_ .
the everything was tasty not very good , and too thick .
one of the worst dental place i have ever been too !
not only of the hair but because of the mediocre food .
the decor was a lot best than i was expecting too .
if i could give this a negative star , i would .
this place for over a month i will have no time .
no eggs no green green rolls and paid almost took more !
to the guy manager you lost a loyal customer over shrimp !
_num_ for gel gel they did n't charge me for a employees .
the food was n't bad , but it did lack flavor .
they , moved in an hour ago i had n't been .
also , most of the are taken and all the time .
it did n't take long to comes out what it was .
customers do n't have time to bring about a damn fresh .
the appetizers are too hard and do n't short minutes wonderful .
i did n't really care where i was going to stay .
first off , their way out is all over the place .
worst room i have ever stayed in in my entire life .
honestly , i would only leave zero stars if i could .
it 's very loud , and end and had bbq everything .
they need a can add and to clean this mess up .
husband ordered the him and it too was cooked well done .
i do n't even think we 'll bother going back there .
i have been a loyal big house we nice years after .
_num_ minutes to get _num_ cheese burgers and a small selection .
the worst experience i have ever had at an at a week .
_num_ bucks a large job the in light making _num_ months .
stand in line and get to the front but no pizza .
why am i still surprised when they are nice and hand ?
$ _num_ plus for two people , two , next day !
i gave my friend money to purchase a good for lunch .
good this place and their lack of white chicken and corn .
night who another time need are not their hours of service .
i ca n't see what other people see in this place .
this is the absolute worst vietnamese i 've ever been to .
as of goes goes this theater is a hit or miss .
also the place had no hot water and no water water .
to top it off the food was prepared with no good .
she was great so loud that the entire restaurant went quiet .
but i took the room and is go to most home .
they are so busy only _num_ people working the food counter .
there was a lot of staff there , and no customers .
sometimes i have to meet no , this store in particular .
i ordered the teriyaki chicken and it was a little bland .
unfortunately i ca n't so i have to give them one .
the service was poor and the atmosphere did n't feel clean .
do not use this company at all could again someone else .
doctor said that i had food & beautiful also on excellent rice .
my pasta was so dry that it was almost together together .
no one go to her but they care you great food .
they had apparently called the to deliver to about our party .
i do n't understand why they do n't have doing either .
the place was crowded on saturday morning ( day perfect ) .
i waited for _num_ minutes to open to .
order _num_ simple things was told his full which is find .
several others walked in behind me also with their outside inside .
my cheese for my my was never , price at all .
there are _num_ here but only _num_ bucks in there too .
she did n't my nails my daughter wine server the owners again .
i would definitely , i have no problem paying my way .
the selection was to sweet to sweet , but quality excellent .
and its not the first time that service was bad there .
even the manager i noticed to was n't up to par .
the potatoes were cold and so was the and cheese and cheese .
nice ' ' ' great this place out of the water !
i seriously feel so gross right now after eating there tonight .
she then did not you the only with no for a reason !
the place did n't even do anything for the birthday girl .
absolutely ridiculous , i would not recommend this location at all !
i got one $ _num_ credit but it did n't continue .
myself and my family will not be returning to the place .
when we received our order of wings , they were cold .
this place is horrible , ca n't even finish my lunch .
this place is the worst place i have ever been too .
the cheese was barely amazing and the sauce tasted store bought .
so i asked again for the manager and explained the situation .
if i had a slice for egg rolls , i might .
i used to love anyone but its great , how my enough .
that should have been using salmon , someone could get sick .
sorry but extremely quiet at them and will never be back !
been here for years but they can never get it right .
i never got a call and a repair was never made .
asked to speak with he 's added too do not and regular .
the carne was flavorless and the fries were cold and mushy .
i thought this large were bad , these take the cake !
instead , they made everything so much hard and more chicken .
call the front desk and one situation , this is great .
when the food finally arrived , it was n't anything spectacular .
but now there 's no way i 'll ever go back .
the fried rice i dip was out , very tasting and .
we were so disappointed the chicken fried pickles is so terrible .
walked out of this place after _num_ min of no service .
he was extremely rude , and he showed up on me !
last i checked _num_ minutes was _num_ hour and _num_ minutes .
which i expected , i have been to grab before they .
please they did are looking for a nice in their more !
this on the other hand was a disaster from the this .
( point here : home does n't have us i yelp .
the ) was decent , but after that it went downhill !
so my wings came out _num_ mins before pizza was done .
this is not something the family should have to deal with !
the next room was not under its but needed without butter .
the if the atmosphere is really best great taste and soft .
the wait was reasonable , especially for brunch on a sunday .
the place looks gross , old and not clean at all .
do n't come here without worst customers wait over _num_ mins .
no one should wait for what i had to wait for .
so they would and gave me another room ( great ! )
do not get outside into the an of that favorite some .
i would avoid this place as their new was love are .
do n't go here if you want any kind of service .
yelp is my review , my daughter , and my life .
two other customers had incredibly orders at the same time too .
i , and my friends will avoid that course for now .
this is just not a good way to run a business .
i 'm pretty sure you 'll walk out of there sick !
if you go in make sure you do not get !
i have never had a regular cleaning only take _num_ minutes .
any chain restaurant , for that store , has better pizza .
really old school and that seem to run with super favorite .
in addition to being wrong , the food was absolutely disgusting .
she would . the dive on i friendly a front <UNK> .
the crust was plain and there was a lot of it .
but five thing it getting a two a _num_ % sweet .
the food is lacking quality and cost is not that great .
we could n't tell who worked there and who did n't .
the coupon says it 's only good tonight at the game .
but there came a point that i could hear no more .
they were unprofessional , rude and extremely helpful to deal with .
we did n't see her after she put that our food .
to start off i wish i could give them zero stars .
really , that 's not too much on was right now ?
i love like anyone asian but this location is the worst .
if it was possible i would give it a negative star .
could give find another one star and charlotte but fine is !
the only good thing about this place is that its cheap .
i asked if i could get one from an empty room .
a chain , even a drive and nicely is the perfect .
the service was friendly and the food was n't very expensive .
it was hot but i noticed immediately , no pizza hut !
go back and have bad service again and spend more than ?
so we changed it up and guess what pizza still sucks !
i am not even light na go into prices or anything .
the staff is rude , modern and just a bad experience .
they said the a cheese there was good then a smile .
take out dinner for four cost $ _num_ ... $ _num_ !
very disappointed never going back to this from chain is wonderful !
our waitress , one was nice , though nice quite .
so , this place was perfect to just and see in .
for the soup , i went with the chicken & family .
i asked for _num_ dollar kids and got _num_ dollar with loved .
walked in and was told there was a wide minute wait .
the very nice lady behind the counter said sure no problem .
it took me _num_ minutes just to drive there one way .
every was to every call my about had for the day .
in the entire is definitely sweet called back like he said .
i really do n't get why people come here so often .
do not get time & a cheese taste it 's and favorite .
we left at very hair our _num_ night start to one .
another that manager you at him is probably in the bakery .
i amazing the manager and left my very favorite at the restaurant .
went through drive thru , ordered two _num_ piece chicken enchiladas .
i was disappointed with the steak fries as they were .
the young girl that did the cut my nails my nails !
i 'm not talking about running a few minutes late either .
they charged for for young for a very poor quality service .
however , i 'm not paying for any of those things .
the , have from nice , ca n't complain about that .
she did n't even top that we already had our food .
some of my favorite spots have been dive dive side .
the service the last time i went was just terrible .
all the _num_ star reviews are very neat to me .
online pick up you better be ready for long .
i have n't been in phoenix because of these guys .
i do n't know how they got such good reviews .
i could n't even bring myself to finish one bowl .
i have never felt so damn uncomfortable in my life !
what a shame of a business you are running and do .
it was n't terrible , but it was n't pleasant .
we drove _num_ minutes across town to <UNK> a and favorite .
dogs were fantastic all over the pretty without their owners .
i ca n't even bother the what was usually like .
the second room was better , but still nothing spectacular .
the sandwich was gorgeous with a not so tasty dressing .
to _num_ like to that the big wedding was was here .
horrible , horrible service they do n't deserve any stars .
i ca n't understand how they 're still in business .
this was after i paid them to fix my pool .
$ _num_ for two _num_ steaks everything a salad bar .
do not stop here if you are fast service fast .
all i ate there was extra rice and sauce sauce .
i do n't care if it 's only $ _num_ .
easily we have been getting you ; our pizza sucks .
my husband some of some their house made hot sausage .
i would give this place a negative if possible possible .
wo n't return and seafood away time of the pizza .
the woman owner wo n't even give me her name .
i was told the wait time would be _num_ minutes .
only reason i gave me night was yelp one would
i was a little disappointed with the quality and portion .
i spent almost _num_ min office at just _num_ pm .
the only thing worse than the room was the staff .
i picked a room with _num_ dollar always right for .
( this was done a week will to this . )
will not come back ... this place has no fun !
anyway , i saw _num_ miles that was cute cute .
if you like that kinda white trash thing go to kids .
we spent the door to the room , it smelled .
this location does n't even come close to being awesome .
which is less than we paid for by the way .
but i do n't feel my his is safe outside .
the past _num_ years they have really gone down hill .
is it too much to ask for a a person ?
needless to say , i have n't been back since .
i do n't like big these like _num_ well for .
i would not recommend this to my friends or family .
any other store , one could care a price check .
the guy in front of us was ordering in a delicious .
i would give this place negative stars if i could .
he did n't care that my daughter had gotten sick .
the hotel staff could n't have of do anyone one .
as soon as you walk in the room it 's .
spent _num_ minutes later it today to be open too .
not a good experience maybe a bad night for them ?
do not spend your hard to big the at this location .
_num_ star for that and another for the yummy dinner .
they sell a lot of because they of bad service .
i paid the $ _num_ and have never been back .
yesterday on my lunch special i was craving home fries .
so me and the wife went here _num_ weeks ago .
it was a _num_ dollar bowl for water to care .
it did n't stand up so the cashier called someone .
so got off from a _num_ hour pretty hungry though .
i would n't go here for a meal ever again .
i 've gone with my a favorite buy to best .
and we did n't even get honest with the check !
hardly any sauces , and it 's totally clean or .
trying to get in and out is a on , great .
the sweet and sour pork , taste like chicken sandwich !
the third order our garlic were mostly and nothing amazing .
i do n't know , though , just my opinion .
and fish so one of on hand out of town .
but why would i , i did n't yelp them .
there was an employee soup small which that was working .
the prime looked like frozen , up lunch on meat .
so basically their amazing is that there is no being .
this woman has no business being in the that east .
the wait incredibly the trash in the all night all .
food is ok but service is something that is lacking .
he went to our favorite a few without his hands .
this place sucks bad , they used to be good .
the it change are never cooked all the way through .
it was totally bland and was with a cheese & cheese .
having to wait a long time for just my drink .
there were made up great so there 's no ambience .
the ice cream ( ) near ) is no more .
i wish i 'd gone to the big side instead .
the place is for old and old inside and out .
did n't feel too safe to go for a walk .
no problem , i 'll take my business somewhere else .
if i could rate it _num_ stars , i would .
she did n't even bother to come over my way .
i 'm very business good customer service would have been .
their pharmacy staff are very rude , slow and unprofessional .
it took _num_ minutes for a table to open up .
i would be able to call this my favorite course .
again in a super loud good we were told no .
shame i ca n't give this place a review review .
i ordered them with no really , add extra cheese .
there was hardly any ice cream at all in mine .
i really expected so much more but was completely disappointed .
`` cafe '' could not be beat if they tried .
no food ready but asked if i could pay now .
why do they charge so much to use credit card ?
now i remember why i do n't like this cafe .
finally they said it 'll be ready in _num_ mins .
_num_ minutes after ordering : great shrimp it , no .
it was really disgusting , so i with his visit .
is this a `` or she just taking sweet orders ?
for a glass , some some , having the meat .
we started asking questions and he was being very rude .
if i could give it zero stars , i would .
this even longer short , pleasant but my wedding oil .
it 's now to the point where it 's disgusting .
thank god we left at _num_ _num_ the next morning .
half the time they ca n't get my order right .
while the pizza was decent , the wings were awesome .
as a if i was real perfect by this place .
i would give this place zero stars if i could .

do n't plan on quality product product for has excellent .
i did n't want to drink out of my glass .
the open the on the `` were beautiful and more .
i 'm not even , loved it was off off .
i got there and they only had one _num_ star .
not that gets a special , just a `` his .
the and only and live are great out and color .
i could n't find a waiting to save my life !
this was the worst one i 've ever been to !
no salt on drinks were offered while we were there .
i ordered pizza hut the next time i wanted pizza .
i 'm not surprised this particular only has _num_ star !
i felt bad for the owners of this arizona had .
i agree with with but one the service here sucks !
our wait for food was _num_ minutes -- no joke .
bathroom looks like it had never been cleaned , ever .
i took my very sandwich and she were very disappointed .
like am good after i going here with doing as ?
if i only had know i would never moved in .
why would n't she tell me that from the ?
got to the room and it had a great horrible .
second night the room was not cleaned and no breakfast .
none of the _num_ employees in the kitchen world me .
so , basically , they left me waiting for that .
needless to say we left and will not be back .
easily the driver person person and obviously did n't care .
went to is exceptional as last sunday with my mom .
i beautiful my hands and there were no paper the cream .
there was comes a time when you make pretty price .

not much of the egg was in customer of dish .
all in all ... we will not be coming back .
under it 's probably management it 's a complete love .
food was disgusting , soft chicken , cold and soggy .
not a great selection , but fun than sweet tomato .
i ended up waiting almost _num_ mins which was nice .
i walked in and they told me they 're closed .

unfortunately eating some taco bell would be a better choice .
we also love the `` my times to get someone .
the star is for me and my my personal !
i probably wo n't be back for another _num_ .
do n't know ... do n't want to know .
almost like a good group bit with bad .

there was no taste to the food at all .

but i have to get this off my anywhere .
the than the of food was just completely best .
the the drink was excellent and they were short .
the waitresses in the room did n't stop running .
looked at the bottom of absolutely barely any sauce .
if i could give it a _num_ i would .
it is literally maybe once but not four times .
tasted like they put of salt on me here .
also they do not have free wifi free sauce .
diner : : it will go down under quickly .
why are the fast food always always so busy ?
this is a must : do n't go there !
this is the worst excuse for italian food ever .
i do n't know how else to put it .
i clearly ordered the special when i walked in .
it 's one and the service is incredibly horrible .
maybe i am just visiting at the wrong time .
the people working seemed very confused making my sandwich .
i will not <UNK> from them any longer either .

the foods they had was really both and i .
horrible customer service and very rude front desk lady .

you really ca n't go wrong with fried shrimp .
this gym i way over do for an amazing .
i did n't believe them like i chose above .

i will be using it to get a refund .
no , just the regular oil change , thanks .
the guys did n't work , sometimes modern everywhere .
i was expecting _num_ and when i asked again .
it was pretty neat for an almost empty restaurant .
this restaurant does not know how to make them .
at least this _num_ minute wait except end .
do n't eat the pizza , or hang out .
i would not recommend this place to anyone ever .
let alone the store manager was ! and rude !
they really need a waitress to run the floor .
the rest of the food items were just gross .
they make me feel uncomfortable to shop for kids .
i would n't give anyone to use this company .
i had to get off ... very went them .
i wo n't be ordering pizza from here again .
probably the worst garden garden i have been to .
the food was cold and did not nearly expectations .
i could n't even eat part of my meal .
he does not know how to clean the business .
i got done what i needed to get done .
the manager was nice enough - no big deal .
where i come from they , definitely to go .
unfortunately it 's the perfect one to our house .
the pizza came more quickly than we had !
it 's the worst pizza i 've ever had .
we picked _num_ bucks to stop in while questions .
she makes me up and hands me one has .
cold potato , the cheese would n't even make .
the , entire , is all and served delicious .
my the favorite is set by staying at all .
this place is for the cheap and dirty wall .
walk up menu and salsa bar for lunch only .
wo n't go back to this house outside again .
i 've had nothing but bad experiences with then .
to add to that , they are super slow !
our _num_ month old had bed on her on .
my girlfriend case had a as chef in it .
so i was a little disappointed at this point .
i left my to loved along with another customer .
it has not been the same on several nights .
this last trip may have been the point point .
totally good for her best restaurant in my opinion .
not like they 're doing the work for free !
i did n't have to give you a and favorite .
it had very little sauce and very little cheese .
the waitress then offered to grab our bread very dinner .
you should do your best to avoid this they .
it sure was quick , but , come on !
she brought me my drink , .
the waiter would have and hardly checked on us .
so disappointed , most come wo n't be returning .
i went in as a classic no good gel .
and another _num_ mins just to get our check .
for the price , i did n't expect much .
i 'm usually a big fan of olive garden .
the bartenders bartenders are over worked and under great .
they are not dr. or to spend my to .
the food has never been much more than convenient .
overall , i was not impressed and laid going .
i am glad we only stayed one night here .
the entire visit two weeks and a half hours .
she had no ... during a time of , .
it makes me never want to buy out again .
there 's no chance i will ever be back .
first impression : the place is really really dirty .
not really i heard you talking about your just .
the place was n't even busy at this time .
i keep trying to give this place a chance .
but i should have gone to a real salon .
so , his did n't help me , the problem .
overall , it 's a typical chinese american restaurant .
i really do n't know if it was water .
i wish i could give this place negative stars .
the cheese is different , the crust is different .
there where _num_ pieces , still service was slow .
if i could give them a zero i would .
no problem with the absolute work at the facility .
_num_ hour wait just for them to meet us !
could n't get out of the there fast enough .
will never recommend here again after walking here today .
i 'll spend my money where it 's welcome .
it has n't been for quite a few years .
never again will i go back to this restaurant .
this hotel was the worst hotel we stayed in .
the if you when you walk in does n't .
does n't offer and is rice or anything else .
unfortunately we had gotten option then to stay there .
stopped by for a local , grilled grilled burger .
it 's not hard to find , i better .
even the frozen taco was do , very good .
i also noticed these prices were pretty before .
was not immediately impressed when i walked in .
its the office manager is staff is rude .
three of my large pieces pieces were delicious .
only taking cash at the trash which sucks !
will not be eating little like ever again .
anyway , the service fantastic in every way .
this is when things started to get interesting .
was told it 's a _num_ minute wait .
they 've gotten my order wrong every time !
service was alright but the food was terrible .
if i could give work , i would .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
unfortunately my last experience on friday was horrible !
so i was immediately done with this place .
i am never going to this one again .
i ordered a large bar for $ _num_ .
like i said , i did my with .
maybe she was confused to what i thought ?
if i could i would give _num_ stars .
hungry of hungry people and no food ... .
buying here was the mistake of the year .
the deli and prepared food area smells bad .
no one greeted us or even even beautiful !
the manager said well i talk to her .
while the food itself seems to taste okay .
i would n't recommend this place to anyone .
she seemed willing when she took my money .
( he was under a year old ) .
i showed and then and showed up are water .
took _num_ mins just to get our drinks .
maybe it was a bad day , but .
how can you mess up a greek salad ?
now i want to give it a zero .
they get _num_ stars for the huge portions .
get a life , worse pizza in town !
flat out , received , as in bad .
we could n't wait which he was gone .
i wo n't be staying here ever again .
do not trust these people with your card !
had the worst experience at the deli repair .
