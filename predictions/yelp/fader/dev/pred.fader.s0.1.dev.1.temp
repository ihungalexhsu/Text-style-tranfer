every time i have had with her ... she is always rude or inviting .
no problems , no going of people , now , no <UNK> , no .
they had some hard working employees also but avoid this one if you can .
they really need to get some workers in there that know how to cook .
this place does n't deserve one start the yelp said star whole is happy .
it smelled short of the , amazing and fried chicken place else did have .
after slow service this morning i decided to look up this business on yelp .
surprisingly we would a too long for our server party of was _num_ .
i 've had better from other food perfectly shop and brunch places in california .
my husband and i went to share and we went through the drive through .
my baby is the vegetarian prices , prepared in this is just ... amazing .
plus on the rather of the well was full `` ) and generous salad .
i love my pie online and set up a cab option with cash cash .
be polite on the phone , then hang up and talk crap about them .
i was charged for the cheese too because the total was $ _num_ something .
she was not a fan of the hummus she had or the greek salad .
after he had just just many : after friends for $ _num_ minutes over .
next , the total was $ _num_ ( i also ordered a ) sauce .
so he offered to my service _num_ piece white and perfect _num_ ( options .
we stopped by the drive thru sunday morning to pick up often sandwiches .
here , this dish is bland , tasteless and has little to no me .
i say again , do n't ever ever ever ever stay at this hotel !
. the does cash so i paid her for exactly what i had ordered .
worst stay of my life , i wish i could get my money back .
i , along with a couple of friends visited this place last friday night .
really soup was friendly and server was super nice and manager was all next .
at the very best it should have been under $ _num_ for it all .
am , am i am told i will have to wait _num_ am _num_ .
she was beyond rude , even started talking down about us to the staff .
if i ever come to phoenix to visit i will not be staying here .
long story short , _num_ of us returned our meals as they were nasty .
got a entire deal that said i would get a an extra oil change .
when you pay for your order her are taken after into all your late .
after _num_ minutes my pizza was out but only the pizza and all delicious .
i recently went in to a delicious establishment in phoenix az store # _num_ .
i asked if she could some was the money and i had no a .
first years when i walk into the place is the smell of dirty staff .
some of the doctors are ok im to say the business as a whole .
to make any first , the place has all the atmosphere of a will .
needless to say , we had from maybe and sick very great our and .
my you was crab , crust was soft and had no crisp to it .
the lady that was completely no portions and did n't care one bit .
i even asked for a a filet room but our room smells of number .
i really do n't miss this place nor will i ever make this so good .
i could go on and on but i am sure you get the point .
we will be of going for another prices and coming back to this location .
the next morning , we found that the water would be to `` stay .
i had to choose _num_ star otherwise , i could n't love this review !
the waiter said i could n't take the shrimp home because it was excellent .
not the best mexican people i come to is the job is our cheap !
good a would store with gas , wonderful of the items are down nice .
which my mom was sitting at who a nice to were supposed and mine .
i show up a few minutes late and still wait an added minutes later .
_num_ hours after we ordered they want to know where to get the pizza .
i kept her sent no but she and sweet to just never come in .
i will not recommend anyone to this location or any of their are grilled .
i 've stayed at other super _num_ before and it was n't like this .
unfortunately , i am so want the time fine about my experience here today .
another _num_ minutes go by i called back she then told me _num_ minutes .
overall would never visit that location again and would n't you hope to either .
needless to say we spent too much money for a not very nice meal .
my wife and i thought the sauce tasted more like ( than sauce pizza .
making my wings were good as i waited for the pizza to get done .
everytime i come to this particular has i remember why i avoid this one .
long time customer service items i am done with them for a long time .
by the time our food got to the table , our drinks were empty .
i was there just as long as if i had ordered in the store .
very very chicken and business ... not too many or mostly from to choose .
terrible customer service even tell me what how much was on a gift card .
i highly recommend that you never go here unless you want to get an .
the service was very very very very very slow , and a wrong order .
now this place is just a honey dive with little to no to smell .
i tell him `` . , i 'm standing right in this door . ''
it was easy to shop because there is not many people in the ever .
sadly , it took another five mins for our food to , `` to .
for some reason , my room had some outdoor all over the customer as .
i 'm disappointed to say i 'll be coming this one for now on .
some basic and people and people would make the customer experience a lot better !
waitress asked if i would like to box it up and i $ _num_ burrito .
a little more and best and more customer service walk is a place stay .
friendly , i know better than to order wings from a you pool store .
when we received our order it was missing missing with left our both .
the food is not cooked all the way , and , none new .
not be nice , they are trying to provide any excellent about reasonable menu ?
my shrimp burger roll was disgusting , i do n't know a better experience .
never was waited on while the service desk person took customers out of order .
based on my last experience i do n't think i will bring my car
the bread bread was , standard , , and salty all new down .
the customer service that i had there was on and some any other salon .
i had it to another to location and got my favorite , _num_ mins .
called early this morning at to groupon has a special a much change ) .
very he asked he asked they should do my fix before everyone 's else .
it had only been used a few times so it still looked new location .
other pizza places always put `` and everyone when you buy from pizza them .
make sure you have time to , my food got us over two hours !
i will never be back to of buffalo shop and not give so phoenix .
the experience was awful and they should have more caring people our best were .
which is also a place i would not want to ever go back to .
i was so excited to find a place near me , with good reviews .
one time i came in on a friday and only one roll was working .
i tried to complain and the , crab amazing she did n't speak english .
_num_ % tip your friends from is then more if you ask me .
these must have been frozen at some point , they were and tasteless .
it 's not to order to everyone knows the way your business is run .
ordered a large and it had the next to _num_ clean and taken it .
even when they about and should be trying to get of their food .
when i ordered the store , i did not smell one sense of food .
then i waited another _num_ for a great chicken was cold when ordered hot .
i had _num_ minutes to make it to the new location before they closed .
floor and look look like they have been hard and ended up and pleasantly .
i also `` that floor was really and there was no great floor sign .
so in all is this price ... do n't , just ... do n't .
food was warm that was would be a nice and chicken wings were old .
i love mexican food and was craving pho were spot with and chicken dip .
my one take all of onion cheese dressing to go with the least sauce .
honestly this is one of the worst food dining experiences i have ever had .
we gave up on getting him off our and walked out without ordering out .
the meat is dark , the business , i felt even taste like chicken .
the lady that did my my portions had even put a top on a table .
my husband and i came here because we were missing the seafood back home .
i guess if you do n't mind doing that it 's worth $ _num_ .
i had the egg egg , bacon , and cheese sandwich and the spaghetti .
serve it with a a true and a bland dressing , that 's how .
good potatoes and beans or an eggs & are what makes a breakfast burrito .
i would n't write a review on a here unless it makes me off .
they picked up my order and then did n't want to fix it .
i can deal with poor customer service , but glass glass in a '' ?
you get what you pay for ... stayed here to visit family in scottsdale .
the crust on a frozen pizza was better than the crust on this one .
why are they taking over all the , spicy , and car your waiter ?
this is the third time in a delicious , we will not be returning !
by far the worst dining experience i 've ever had in my entire life .
this place was like a town customer and no one could even us more .
i went to agree 's across the street and had food in _num_ minutes .
every time i drive by the store i 'm with the course experience .
you 're not going to find any of that locations crispy the bar city .
the `` '' '' is n't in the name to make it pretty much .
i was told that i would have to wait over a week for repair .
the room is simple with a small visit nicely , , and reasonable , .
come on people , the is the and amazing for having a lunch !
this place did not and i was willing to finish my $ _num_ % .
i 'm not sure the food was old or it 's a great pizza .
the selection was better but probably because it 's a big the food on customer .
if you do n't ... well be prepared for your order to be wrong .
but 's favorite is at least on par with pizza hut and on service .
disgusting rooms ... ... get ... amazing and more delicious people ... horrible experience .
they do n't take my number number ( _num_ ) only up to _num_ .
my pedicure , however , turned out okay with this crab on the could .
it did n't taste horrible , just cheap ... so only a in very he .
i used to love the fresh appetizer , but this visit they were awful .
, i think i believe there ) go places here to eat in the area .
going in with out for a quick bite to eat i ordered the nachos .
i took my _num_ old dog getting into her first cleaning room through .
i asked for a to come for a table a bit sweet and shrimp .
needs a new not , they say `` as is '' i get it .
i have to say it 's the worst all worst a food in the valley .
we waited _num_ minutes while workers workers walked before when would help us .
so he walked to hand me my order and then asked for the money .
the customer service is usually awful and the cashier are doctors are going first .
this hotel was the worst i have ever stayed in and very felt food .
i do n't want to spend their third minutes of my lunch hour waiting .
i asked them to put it on tap instead because that would taste better .
is their experience so your that they can continue to treat people like crap ?
no one should have to wait _num_ hours to make a vet a vet .
there were many customer dogs in the store , and nobody was them !
got off the phone another _num_ min later the driver got to our house .
i gave him the same happy but my cut to cut their out amazing .
he was helpful at first but than treated us as if we were stupid .
the guy said sorry for the wait but he did n't mean it .
i the manager hand inside has been ever for over three months now .
i ca n't imagine that they did n't give me or great or .
but do n't the car the chef out of gas to come here .
i do n't know what happened but the crust is not the same .
i have better tacos at home and appetizer 's chicken for taco service .
to be honest the only thing that was good was the drinks drinks .
too much bread ( $ ) for not enough meat ( meat ) .
had different most of the times ignored , they never returned my call .
tried to doctors to office they and turned me back to the manager .
the neighborhood is bad and it is some i received their customers their customers .
why number if you ca you seen my haircut to serve your patients ?
the salad was on the crab , not easy on the anything else .
so i do not recommend this location plus , they hardly have anything .
i feel like on best a park service would have satisfied me more !
great have n't been cleaned in years you can see some _num_ from .
of course , i called management and they said they would immediately immediately .
i have never had such terrible service , especially from management as well .
that good me you are not paying attention to what you are doing .
after this experience , we 're not sure if we want to return .
my girlfriend and i love this our house , usually late at night .
i had to tell one of the but they did they care .
made an appointment to get my oil changed at all on tuesday pm .
let me be fresh is so to i do n't like this place .
this gym is always dirty , and is recommended was much into customer .
i ca n't help but understand why is in such in front they set .
not _num_ pm _num_ minutes i was in there and i was gone .
nothing to write home about , but i 'll write it on yelp .
i went back through the gift with another reservation to were big food .
we walk up and wait a bit in line , no big deal .
another _num_ minutes goes by and we have no water and no service .
i do n't know what happened but the veggie bbq no longer longer .
if anything , she seemed annoyed that she had to watch the order .
it was n't horrible tasting food , just bland for what i love .
the bathrooms were very clean and the amazing we were in was comfortable .
for something that was their fault so we got our and left .
the spinach beef i found completely : the burger was very unique again .
had no idea it was spring and food of foot of wings she .
as im using the one week of the workers can to clean .
also worth , sausage , , remember , and the traditional traditional american .
this location on the other hand is dirty , unfriendly , and unprofessional .
i wanted to give you zero stars but it would n't let me .
i ordered a crispy chicken classic with fries and job to back work .
been here for about _num_ waiting & still have n't gotten my food .
they need to time their employees some ! and how service works service !
glasses glasses would be ready for within within _num_ to _num_ business days .
in general , this excellent just was not a fun place to be .
not her , and this location is going to pay for her mistake .
i love the wings but they are n't worth the beyond terrible service .
however i have two main things that restaurant a great low rating again .
they did not bother you call why i asked if they were closed .
we waited _num_ minutes we were not even offered any water or anything .
this was the most disgusting place i 've stayed in a long time .
but on the west side they do have hot as an taste by .
it was our first time at red lobster , and probably our last .
they lost touch and do n't know how to deal with the wall !
this place does n't even deserve the one star i 'm giving them .
i went to red lobster today with my family the service was horrible .
plus he was n't very helpful with them on this in the coffee .
she talked me the great and said `` what do you think ? ''
i walk away and go to the greatest and ask for a manager .
i have never had not to wait in a different minute wait line .
i saw them ordered _num_ small `` old of me and said no .
i ran out of this place and i will never ever come back !
i sent my boyfriend within ten to go for our order dinner .
the place was filthy and the woman behind the counter was incredibly rude .
unfortunately we will never make the . of going to this location again !
it just looked like the bed had been made and that 's it .
i asked them how long it would take actually a me _num_ mins .
i may shop there again - not ( unless 's food two ) .
that 's too bad this food is the , new to my house .
my husband thought the soup was good and the egg roll was crispy .
did n't offer hot and sour soup at lunch , only egg rolls .
now pizza is beyond awful and wings are down with there excellent product .
the meat was like a lunch meat instead of real eye beef beef .
if we had waited any longer , they all would have been dead !
my salad was meh and my entree 's ribs were a little dry .
the simple doctor was super to help me with a they needed i .
my appetizer was cold , half of the bowl of job was said .
it was like our wedding as we checked from three they added had .
food was `` meh '' , maybe i just ordered the wrong thing .
it 's like you asked them to walk _num_ miles to get some .
there 's reasonable time to park at least just not enough of them .
service - excellent ... appetizers appetizers are served on this were going for .
i have went to this location over a times ) in vegas school .
the food looked old , the lettuce , good they just pretty gross .
it was two `` of the wedding but that was a real
i had her order the steak and shrimp with veggie bowl for me .
this has to be the worst pizza hut location i have been to .
ordered the family delicious which and only chicken , fries and garlic bread .
food : the first room they put me in of room they set !
i 'm glad i got this for such a cheap price through !
finally the food comes , and of course , the order is wrong .
when she comes off our food she gave us the check as well .
a little over an hour wasted sitting waiting ... absolutely horrible customer service .
she would have ignored me completely had i was not for her attention .
i have to say , i find the meat to be super , perfect .
there was a very beef outside priced looking and went into the lobby .
there was no sign or anything to say i could n't park there .
ask for fried rice with your meal they give you chicken fried rice .
i told the lady that it was and she did n't be stop .
the waitress just left the mess she made for is to clean up .
i hate them for not giving me the option by great _num_ hours .
the front door was broken off of the that added the 's the counter .
i hardly also they their enjoyed their on a monday which if he .
she returned a couple later and asked some cool , but and single .
also the manager is 's knowledgeable they do not type section $ _num_ .
my food experience was just so great and terrible at the same time .
i ca n't believe that i just paid $ _num_ for her above .
so they leave you with a terrible experience every , single , time .
this is my second trip to this place and both excellent but probably .
other than that i do n't know who else could appreciate this place .
but i am not sure about the frozen lunch meat you are offered .
i ca n't do this place & will never recommend it to anyone .
not going to very different another sent out because we 're so hungry .
it 's a shame to watch this place take the turn it has .
this place was outstanding ... service and , the food was nasty looking .
however , just the other night , i found like in my pizza .
i said , i 'm sorry , i did n't see any definitely .
in a city with a well market do n't waste your cash here .
i leave not even a that spicy came others off out again .
lots of issues with the games not working and not giving care 's .
i immediately stopped eating and threw it in the trash and left disgusted .
i can excuse the mess because i know how care , `` be .
the cashier asked i 've been to eat because there is not worth ?
i _num_ miles _num_ miles to the to delivery which is much good .
any overall do i need to i get to a drink around here ?
it was a thick burger with cafe with he , classic & cheese .
it took us about _num_ min to get the foods on the table .
when i first walked in , i was hit with that bathroom smell .
i got like a and it had to be three bites of egg .
first bite was great , then my wife love that it was excellent .
there were a is of three go to me super my food around .
i would rather be dirty than stay one more min in this place .
i had to spend the day cleaning and getting one and bed through !
the front desk never called to check in the pool had been have .
how else can one phoenix the _num_ and _num_ stars for this place ?
it takes many were , and takes longer then _num_ minutes to do !
the course is in even worse from steaks on , their woman out .
i paid _num_ for a no _num_ combo with a full small cuisine .
when she fun to work i love they gave me chicken and shrimp .
we stay at least _num_ a lot , but this is the worst .
without times , i had received a coupon for a free large pizza .
do n't waste your money here if you are looking for a meal .
my boyfriend got orange chicken and chicken teriyaki that we so though everything .
but have i got asian but he knows my hair up yesterday yesterday .
then they did not have the part and place for the next week !
the great when i the sales the door to be was quite very .
the chicken was great _num_ , great and tasted like it was of .
there are three left and i believe this is the worst of them .
if you ask after they give you your hair they get all our .
as such , the quality and of the italian to you are easily .
you wo n't get good ( a hours as being about your vehicle .
i call them and they and tell me what they will give me .
was in the area and thought i would stop in for a burger .
one was really , our product and even or even to take one .
this would have been the second time the tried to obviously charge me .
we did n't have to wait very long before our meal was delivered .
girl is like in the `` that `` 's what she ordered ! ''
finally , we were & to keep our ( a third to complain .
ok , all done with red lobster for a good long , either .
this seems to be a here completely thought that i do n't like .
i am not sure what was worse ... the food or the employees .
needless to say , i would n't recommend this company to anyone ever !
also , someone said the iced are a great hang out with ?
they were out of , timely so i expected more veggies on it .
i spoke with a manager , i delivery got about happy hour drinks .
normally a person will tip _num_ % - _num_ % of their bill .
sat down and saw people getting seated that came in after i did .
well server was far then original , so he just just moved off .
the problem is the management & the maintenance staff do not fix anything .
when i arrived to pick it up they did n't have it .
for family , we got the stuffed n with shrimp and lobster .
the store is very busy from again to about size at night .
my husband and i were dining here for almost day last year .
and food is cold , soggy , not edible by any means .
another reviews had been put into the the honey could not place .
my poor service with , no with experience the only _num_ old .
apparently , i was not the only one with the best issue .
it a hole in the wall in the middle of was more .
we still had to wait longer than our pick pick up time .
i guess everyone is so used to their steaks and a veggie .
the only answer i got was prices are different after hours hours .
she talked to perfectly me on the meal , i say no .
go and side of corn were so salty it ruined the meal .
all in all , we were really disappointed and will not return .
so we sat there for _num_ minutes before she even sat us .
the pizza hut was good and the wings were big and fresh .
well : one the great customer service i was ever a veggie .
me and my husband went here last saturday for an early dinner .
they would n't just from it our bill salad such any was .
this place does n't deserve any stars their customer service is horrible !
when clearly cashier , he like he still did n't hear me .
she says no i 'm a ( you less than that of .
then he had to leave and try and get my refund refund .
had i 've it i would have given it a solid _num_ .
the dressing was thin and tasteless , very little got cheese flavor .
the egg roll , over cooked , greasy , stale and horrible !
maybe that 's why the inside of the restaurant was so dead .
but lack of respect , i am looking somewhere else this evening .
if you like these chinese food another , then love this review .
the attitude just gets worse as you 're shopping and checking out .
our waitress seemed meat and never even came back to refill style .
not to mention , they picked up on my pharmacy 's order .
they always mess up my order and give me the wrong food .
the office never any that he and does n't return any will .
the only thing different is that they cleaned the paper little these .
called in a delivery order from this location and it was late .
took _num_ minutes to get our drinks and the order was wrong .
wonderful in the and best too _num_ menu on top of bed !
i was there yesterday , and the line was exceptional customers through .
i tried a side of when service and it seemed very very .
first , the driver was super late to pick up our stuff .
she did huge to meet a order of fries free of charge .
this is by far the worst nail salon i have been too .
when you 're through the worst , get great and to the grocery .
i do not taste , do n't have to and never have .
the least they could do was was treat in place of of anyone .
save your money and get a $ _num_ hot n their buy !
i ca n't wait to get in number of because of this !
i am not sure what the big deal is about this place .
i would suggest they their someone with more like come with customers .
my man did n't even finish his good and that never apologized .
very disappointment , customer service very poor and food was not good .
a month later , i still had not received my to home .
i called to help one of my employees get an apartment today .
it simply did n't `` hit the spot '' so to speak .
said she 'd be back with it , never returned with one .
i also asked for hot sauce , guess what i got instead ?
they give my bread and be the honey beef in the ever .
she said , `` they 're really busy in the back . ''
( to eat , not to love , but to eat ) .
it might actually be worse than little nor 's or - particular .
not of love for this experience , probably n't come here again .
they need table had , glasses glasses , , and great and .
but what was n't . the was salt of great at the food .
guess i 'll have to keep to just to shop taco bell .
the worst experience i have ever had at a dr 's office !
first off we were treated over the drive thru water work again .
then someone just before the yelp review , so here i am .
she walked us and said not by nice as we walked in .
just got a a veggie pizza for the best time in arizona .
the cheese pita might be the same _num_ , close to it .
no way i could make it across town on a friday night .
but quite nice if you are not into that type of thing .
it is all about up family and they come at this vet .
while i was eating , a , bean rather in someone about !
i am sad to see how much this place has gone downhill .
the front end did not take and they would me got so .
we waited for _num_ minutes and ended up leaving with no food .
i would n't trust our car did n't know my to turn .
she did n't greet me or traditional ... what i was there .
i had never been to a and only bit like this one .
who does n't want to meet every minute of their lunch hour ?
i drive back there and wait in line to return my food .
could n't check the second room since our they ca n't work .
it was the most most most important thing he could have done .
they neighborhood with me and gave me a favor $ _num_ credit !
i did n't have a people , it 're a with seat .
right now , _num_ - cheese cut or vegan do and _num_ .
the manager was right at the cashier while we chose our order .
a month and problem and now i am above having another experience .
i just one on my classic in the wall wall 's back .
when she took the right 's perfectly she a nails completely have appreciated .
yelp yelp people - why is n't there a zero star rating ?
the server tasted the bar , the food was mediocre at best .
i did n't care for the food , thought it was bland .
very limited choices in to very meat , vegetables , and sauces .
she walked out and left me in there for half an hour .
i spent $ _num_ and they want me to pay for _num_ .
with the first bite i knew it was not what i expected .
the drive thru is incredible for the staff there are rude !
by far one of the worst shopping experiences i 've ever had .
great : like the only server employee in this whole entire apartment .
she ended up with a right first white on her on sausage .
when is the last time you were here '' all tv here .
the rest are are all , , and extremely rude and unprofessional !
we found _num_ in a _num_ , the rest was n't cleaned .
it would have been fine or i would have went else where .
if this is a change order , it is not a good one .
for that reason , i 'll recommend stay away from this establishment .
probably the least other food chinese i 've had in my life .
i then asked how long it would take was before _num_ hours .
i need to to one i get and for your _num_ back .
and the staff in the cafe is not the most friendly fan .
they were quite cold so we asked for something a little get .
i only go since it is on the way home from work .
there are way better places than here or please look else where .
when , new , was willing to give the a chance chance .
i totally agree but the way he said it was very was .
the repair was made and the bike stopped working the same night .
there were like _num_ or _num_ other tables in the whole place .
my son had a horrible experience with the staff at this walmart .
i requested a nice to say works on a tuesday after hours .
i guess i need to that would get more clearly next time .
the end had was missing for a bit on the floor floor .
this is easily the worst _num_ times i have ever stayed in .
the service sucked all from the second we walked in the door .
it took them two days to come out and fix my vehicle .
the service was friendly but the food was not worth the money .
however , now as an . the experience was not the same .
then , the server tried to charge me for a new ranch !
he says like things i could n't `` `` quality '' too .
the customer service is none the girls and the cook are rude .
but it even and run chinese food prepared for a mexican mexican .
the whole drink area was a mess as was the dining area .
had we had any other choices , we would have taken them .
we walked in and the place was dirty and not well stocked .
i was disappointed to see the yelp yelp had green - why ?
we should have gotten up and walked out to go somewhere else .
manager said i could pay more to get a a veggie change .
the room room good , but that was n't even the start .
this is a this vet and everything bad that solid just do .
i called the salon before the groupon to check my fresh their .
so we she did get to see him but almost by very .
_num_ and a half hours for a go-to _num_ min oil change .
i would not recommend this salon , nor will i be returning .
i was disappointed that our pizza did n't have that this time .
only reason i gave them _num_ star is because i had to .
they also left a greasy hand on my light on as salt .
they give you a short wait time , but did n't deliver .
she immediately got an attitude and told me they was not cold .
they do n't have a person working around drive the back crispy .
all i could taste was extremely burnt and salmon and few crab .
as soon as she saw me she knew why i was there .
i 'm only giving one star because i ca n't give zero .
saw the show and came to see _num_ stars , making it .
the store manager told the sales guy to give me an amazing .
other than the food which was lacking , so was the service .
. : even & i , appreciate your for a time .
the cashier do n't understand you and the order was very asking .
the be bread , food , after that it was all downhill !
we are late for our food at this point and beyond reliable .
now , the one i thought i was rather , is not .
the owner wo n't return early and the staff wo n't help .
both times the bartender was too busy to take my dinner order .
unfortunately for the price of lobster here the with homemade was definitely .
good that they had it on them , i didnt even ask .
if the driver driver would 've helped , i would of 'm .
usually , i could use my groupon right away but whatever '' .
the place was dirty with my group running around out of for .
not only is the service terrible , the management is terrible .
asked for sausage egg cheese with bacon or side of sausage .
you can keep your your black and sour salsa , here .
the pizza and the wings were n't all that good either .
but they wo n't be getting any business business from me .
first , the cashier clearly did n't want to be there .
this is a oil change '' atmosphere with two really gift .
so of course i am going to use the vet visit .
the point of having a _num_ hour location is for you .
the girl to a hotel and an staff and was asked !
if i could give this place no stars , i would .
at that point i had it and left with no food .
i had to stay outside in the hot style of _num_ .
the the bread was not very good , and too thick .
one of the worst animal hospital i have ever been too !
not any of the hair but because of the mediocre food .
the decor was a lot more than i was expecting too .
if i could give this a negative star , i would .
this theater for over a month i will have no cheese .
our eggs no green never , eggs and almost quite dollars !
to the time manager you lost a loyal customer over shrimp !
_num_ for gel gel they did n't charge me for anyone .
the food was n't bad , but it did lack flavor .
they said , after years of going there i am done .
also , most of the walls are taken all the time .
it did n't take long to hang out what it was .
customers do n't have time to be about a damn worked .
the greens are too hard and do n't hold a black .
i did n't really care where i was going to stay .
first off , their few is out all over the place .
worst room i have ever stayed in in my entire life .
honestly , i would only leave zero stars if i could .
it 's very loud , well and would eat there anywhere .
they need a ton . and to clean this mess up .
husband ordered the to rice here and was cooked well done .
i do n't even think we 'll bother going back there .
i have been a loyal big customer service for many years .
_num_ minutes to get _num_ cheese burgers and a small fry .
the worst experience i have ever had at an right location .
# _num_ % light every had to light # _num_ # .
great in line and get to the front but no pizza .
why am i still surprised when they car are and ?
$ _num_ plus for two for people , one bowl each !
i gave my friend money to purchase me food for lunch .
good place this and their lack of white chicken and corn .
out the out about servers are not their hours of service .
i ca n't see what other people see in this place .
this is the absolute worst we 've i 've been to .
as of nice goes this theater is a hit or miss .
also the only had no hot water and no water great .
to top it off the food was prepared with no good .
she was pleasantly so loud that the entire restaurant went quiet .
the should my staff the room and to either floor hell .
they are so busy only _num_ people working the food counter .
there was a lot of staff there , and no customers .
sometimes i have to repeat no , this store in particular .
i ordered the teriyaki chicken and it was a little bland .
unfortunately i ca n't so i have to give them one .
the service was poor and the atmosphere did n't feel clean .
do not use this company at all seriously call someone else .
doctor said that i had food from different and soft meat .
my pasta was so dry that it was almost crisp together .
possibly no one here `` that they serve you horrible food .
they had apparently called the just to complain about our nothing .
i do n't understand why they do n't do dressing either .
the place was crowded on monday morning ( including day ) .
i waited for _num_ minutes to open to the classic my .
order the green things was told him great salsa is find .
several walked walked in behind they had so of our orders .
my cheese for my very i was n't , good and all .
there are _num_ food but only _num_ miles in there too .
she did n't on them _num_ locations even clean them out .
i like a , i have no problem paying my way .
the selection was n't sweet to sweet , but your black quality .
and its not the first time that service was bad there .
even the manager i spoke to was n't up to par .
the potatoes were cold and so was the and cheese and cheese .
good she ' ' really this place out of the water !
i seriously feel so gross right now after eating there tonight .
she then did not follow the there up with a reason !
the place did n't even do anything for the birthday girl .
absolutely ridiculous , i would not recommend this location at all !
i got one $ _num_ credit but it did n't continue .
myself and my family will not be returning to the place .
when we received our order of wings , they were cold .
this place is horrible , ca n't even finish my lunch .
this place is the worst place i have ever been too .
the cheese was barely crisp and the sauce tasted store bought .
so i asked again for the manager and explained the situation .
if i had a craving for egg rolls , i might .
i used to love olive garden but its always so impressed .
that should have been cleaned as , someone could get sick .
sorry but extremely pissed at them and will never be back !
been here for years but they can never get it right .
i never got a call and a repair was never made .
asked to speak with he he look that not do at .
the carne was flavorless and the fries were cold and mushy .
i thought says were bad were , these take the cake !
instead , they made everything so much hard and more will .
call the front desk and ! one , this is your .
when the food finally arrived , it was n't anything spectacular .
but now there 's no way i 'll ever go back .
the fried fried in waitress was , over priced and pepper .
we were so disappointed the chicken fried sauce is so terrible .
walked out of this place after _num_ min of no service .
he was extremely rude , and he hung up on me !
last i checked _num_ minutes was _num_ hour and _num_ minutes .
which i expected , i have been to , gel before .
please hope they are looking for a around customer your is !
this on the other hand was a work from the middle .
( point here : fresh before great would have your ) .
the be bread , food , but after it went downhill !
so my wings came out _num_ mins before pizza was done .
this is not something the family should have to deal with !
the next room was not under ? but clearly needed care .
the perfect for the pizza has lost it taste and texture .
the wait was reasonable , especially for brunch on a sunday .
the place looks gross , old and not clean at all .
do n't come here without saying do wait over _num_ mins .
no one should wait for what i had to wait for .
so they nice and gave me another room ( ?
do not get yet the ordering , of that horrible waiter .
i would avoid this place as their any prices are my dive .
do n't go here if you want any kind of service .
yelp is my review , my friend , and my life .
two other customers had yelp orders at the same time too .
i , and my friends will avoid that course for now .
this is just not a good way to run a business .
i 'm pretty sure you 'll walk out of there sick !
if you go in make sure you do not get me !
i have never had a regular cleaning only take _num_ minutes .
any chain restaurant , for that matter , has better pizza .
really old and one and that seem to run super very .
in addition to being wrong , the food was absolutely disgusting .
she would best on the in taste in small <UNK> ) .
the crust was plain and there was a lot of it .
but worst server it truly getting a _num_ % cooked pizza .
the food is lacking quality and cost is not that great .
we could n't tell who worked there and who did n't .
the coupon says it 's only good tonight at the game .
but there came a point that i could treat more no .
they were unprofessional , rude and extremely difficult to deal with .
we did n't see her after she comes off our food .
to start off i wish i could give them zero stars .
really , that 's not too much to change , right ?
i also like olive garden but this location is the worst .
if it was possible i would give it a negative star .
'' could give another star for but parking is good : !
the only good thing about this place is that its cheap .
i asked if i could get one from an empty room .
normally area , even a security itself is walking the lobby .
the service was friendly and the food was n't very expensive .
it was hot but i noticed immediately , no pizza hut !
go back and have bad service again and spend more $ ?
so we changed it up and guess what pizza still sucks !
i am not even na na go into prices or anything .
the staff is rude , get and just a bad experience .
they said the us was there but could n't find us .
take out dinner for four cost $ _num_ ... $ _num_ !
very disappointed never going back to this pizza is great ... !
our waitress , . , was nice , though quite rushed .
so , this place was perfect to just deliver and go .
for the soup , i went with the chicken & owner .
i asked for _num_ fresh chef and got _num_ 1/2 beds .
walked in and was told there was a regular minute wait .
the very nice lady behind the counter said sure no problem .
it took me _num_ minutes just to drive there one way .
good , i went about my and style for the day .
sauce in the department had never called back like he said .
i really do n't get why people come here so often .
do not get with 'll fresh sauce ... it 's is .
we left at least our day _num_ night start to one .
another one that should n't have happened was in the bakery .
i like the box and left my girlfriend at the restaurant .
went through drive thru , ordered two of _num_ chicken calamari .
i was disappointed with the steak fries as they were mushy .
the young girl that did the ) cut my nails nails !
i 'm not talking about a watch out late late either .
they charged for the too now to get very poor service .
however , i 'm not paying for any of those things .
the this are really quiet , ca n't complain about that .
she did n't even beat that we already had our food .
some of my favorite bars have been dive dive , .
the service the last time i went was just terrible .
all the _num_ star reviews are very willing to me .
online pick up you go like this for long right .
i have n't been in again because of these waitress .
i do n't know how they got such good reviews .
i could n't even bring myself to finish one bowl .
i have never felt so damn uncomfortable in my life !
what a shame of a business you are running running .
it was n't terrible , but it was n't pleasant .
we drove _num_ minutes across town to <UNK> a like .
dogs were _num_ many over the movie without their owners .
i ca n't even imagine what the kitchen looks like .
the second room was better , but still nothing spectacular .
the sandwich was ! with a not so tasty dressing .
to any is the , very patient size was nice .
horrible , horrible service they do n't deserve any stars .
i ca n't understand how they 're still in business .
this was after i paid them to fix my pool .
$ _num_ for two _num_ teriyaki steaks _num_ salad bar .
do not stop here if you are many fast service .
all i ate there was moist rice and , crab sauce .
i do n't care if it 's only $ _num_ .
considering we have been getting ; that our pizza sucks .
my husband purchased some of their house made hot sausage .
i would give this place a negative stars if possible .
wo n't return and threw away care of the pizza .
the woman owner wo n't even give me her name .
i was told the wait time would be _num_ minutes .
only reason i gave a star was yelp just a world and
i was a little disappointed with the quality and portion .
i spent almost _num_ min at just at _num_ truly .
the only thing worse than the room was the staff .
i a first a room with _num_ who make no .

anyway , i saw _num_ which had that was cute .
if you like that kinda white ( ever # them .

this location does n't even come close to being awesome .
which is less than we paid for by the way .
but i do n't feel my vehicle is safe outside .
the past _num_ years they have really gone down hill .
is it too much to ask for a did bad ?
needless to say , i have n't been back since .
i do n't like big awesome over them on my '' .
i would not recommend this to my friends or family .
any other store , one could be a price check .
the guy in front of us was ordering in they .
i would give this place negative stars if i could .
he did n't care that my daughter had gotten sick .
the hotel staff could n't have cares about anyone one .
as soon as you walk in the room it shows .
spent _num_ minutes ago that to finally be pretty bad .

there was an employee glass beer while he was working .
the meats looked like frozen , so having lunch meat .

i wish i 'd gone to the big someone instead .
the place is because and old looking inside and out .

no problem , i 'll take my business somewhere else .
if i could rate it _num_ stars , i would .
she did n't even bother to come over my way .
i 'm sat because good customer service would have been .
their pharmacy staff are very rude , slow and unprofessional .

if i could give negative rating through i would .
the waitresses they had was really outdated and had .
horrible customer service and very rude front desk lady .
had n't been to this place in _num_ years .
they are never worth for this by the way .
it 's just not an enjoyable place to play .
that was the only good thing about this place .
no paper waitresses anywhere in gas or getting area .
they were a soggy , greasy , fresh mess .
as most not still stuck in the drive thru .

i was found ignored and when i asked again .
it was pretty many for an almost empty restaurant .
this restaurant does not know how to make them .
at least this _num_ minute wait saturday end is .
do n't eat the pizza , or hang out .
i would not recommend this place to anyone ever .
let the pool time and simply and enjoyed rude !
they really need a waitress to run the floor .
the rest of the food items were just gross .
they make me feel uncomfortable to shop for as .
i would n't imagine anyone to use this company .
i had to get off they go and them .
i wo n't be ordering pizza from here again .
probably the worst olive garden i have been to .
the food was cold and did not be other .
i could n't even eat part of my meal .
he does not know how to day the business .
i got done what i needed to get done .
the manager was nice enough - no big deal .
where i come from they excellent , not here .
unfortunately it 's the in new to our house .
the pizza came more quickly than we had a young !
it 's the worst pizza i 've ever had .
we picked _num_ great to stop in while this .
she , my drinks and hands me one cup .
cold potato , the cheese would n't even even .
the the tried , the prices and were n't fresh .
my my atmosphere is set by ordering at was reasonable .
this place is for the cheap and dirty more .
walk up menu and salsa bar for lunch only .
wo n't go back to this house house again .
i 've had nothing but bad experiences with then .
to add to that , they are super slow !
our _num_ month old had bed special on her .
my girlfriend case had a my baked in it .
so i was a little disappointed at this point .
i left my amazing there along with another customer .
it has not been the same on several stars .
this last trip may have been the customer point .
totally bar to your family restaurant in my opinion .
not like they 're doing the work for free !
i did n't have to give you a i .
it had very little sauce and very little cheese .
the waitress then offered to refill our bread bread .
you should do your best to avoid this around .
it sure was quick , but , come on !
she brought me my drink , the way the calamari .
the waiter would friendly and hardly checked on us .
so disappointed , most importantly wo n't be returning .
i went in as a no cars being charged .
and another _num_ mins just to get our check .
for the price , i did n't expect much .
i 'm usually a big fan of olive garden .
the evening bartenders are over worked and under favorite .
they are not special or to tell my go .
the food has never been much more than convenient .
overall , i was not impressed and very new .
i am glad we only stayed one night here .
the entire visit two times and a half hours .
she had no roll during a time of n't .
it makes me never want to buy furniture again .
there 's no chance i will ever be back .
first we food was this place is really dirty .
not really i heard you talking about your here .
the place was n't even busy at this time .
i keep trying to give this place a chance .
but i should have gone to a real salon .
so , his water did n't help the problem .
overall , it 's a typical chinese american restaurant .
i really do n't know if it was water .
i wish i could give this place negative stars .
the cheese is different , the crust is different .
there where _num_ waiters , still service was slow .
if i could give them a zero i would .
no problem with the orange care at the facility .
_num_ hour wait just for them to to spicy !
could n't get out of the food they enough .
will never play here again after shrimp here today .
i 'll spend my money where it 's welcome .
it has n't been for quite a few years .
never again will i go back to this restaurant .
this hotel was the worst hotel we stayed in .
the an while you walk in does n't smile .
does n't offer and on service or anything else .
unfortunately we had option option then to stay there .
stopped by for a local , any grilled burger .
it 's not hard to find , i tea .
even the frozen sure did n't taste very good .
i also noticed these prices were pretty pretty .
was not immediately impressed when i walked in .
know the office manager ... is really rude .
three of my large furniture pieces were time .
only taking cash at the moment which sucks !
will not be eating little ever ever again .
anyway , the service lacked in every way .
this is when things started to get excellent .
was told it 's a _num_ minute wait .
they 've gotten my order wrong every time !
service was alright but the food was terrible .
if i could give , everything i would .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
unfortunately my last experience on friday was horrible !
so i was immediately done with this place .
i am never going to this one again .
i ordered a large love for $ _num_ .
like i said , i did my my quality .
maybe she was confused to what i 'm ?
if i could i would give _num_ stars .
best of hungry people and no food ... .
buying here was the mistake of the year .
the deli and prepared food area smells bad .
no one greeted us or even even us !
the manager said well i talk to her .
while the food itself seems to taste okay .
i would n't recommend this place to anyone .
she spoke english when she took my money .
( he was under a year old ) .
i showed at someone did showed of customer talking .
took _num_ mins just to get our drinks .
maybe it was a bad day , but .
how can you mess up a greek salad ?
now i want to give it a zero .
they get _num_ stars for the huge portions .
get a life , worse pizza in town !
flat out of service in as smells bad .
we could n't wait what was he gone .
