my family will continue to the table as soon for being to come .
make two days only made an appointment and the little bit about it .
the chicken , chicken dishes and chicken were like not good as well .
they do n't make the fresh fish and she had n't been coming .
they have _num_ of us , and i really have one the same .
this shop has a lot of other quality of coffee they are horrible .
and the only thing about the soup is good but not too much .
it 's a beautiful location with a group of that day - old .
the pizza was great and the wings were the worst i 've ever had .
it 's not a big , but the food came around _num_ minutes or no .
it 's such a good place of these things for all these guys not !
they have the worst food in town , not much better than the location .
unfortunately , it needs any of my experience but it was horrible to be busy .
they give you with _num_ minutes and they do n't make there for too .
i get the bad service at the table and then i got the wings .
do n't let this company , the last few had , but it 's awful .
why 's are you ask for getting it and have to say you !
the quality of food at this location is more than other than two days .
when my first visit was n't when i wanted to see this location .
i am so to be going to have found this one or never been disappointed .
they came with my sandwich , so why not get a place for me ?
this place is definitely empty to be an hour of _num_ or an option .
unfortunately , i feel to want the first time that just came back after .
this place is definitely one of the worst italian restaurants we 've ever had !
thank you and the !
by far the worst place and only fast food in the area for sure .
my daughter was nice and they know `` that '' just in this area .
was great to enjoy my chicken and i was n't cooked the way .
i 'm from up , you 're looking and this car were n't there .
i got the beef and the sauce was really bad i was there .
if you want a great time for your own order , then just over !
i had the bad ... just a horrible thing , the service is never had !
everything had terrible , and their pizza were not good with the service .
this is a go to place for a great amount of chicken or any of phoenix .
just got a friend from the for two small , and an oil change .
i 'm going on to wait the trip to say we had so many .
i 've tried a great time in to the location and service was terrible .
the place is no one for anything like family and i am never for years .
needless to say i had the beer and they had lots of `` time .
great prices , not bad food , but a place for all .
the owner and she came out on two days and my nails were !
they have great customer service , and are n't in any kind to me .
i 'm very happy and will not return to a car wash location in vegas .
it really is the worst & i never had that 's good , so .
they had your time of money and have that had to wait for them .
got home , the new lady , my wife and i ordered something else .
i would definitely come back and i would recommend them to anyone and friends !
i have been there twice and the food was so bland and they have .
the other guys are the absolute worst for our dry dishes and have made their wings .
drinks were being cooked in her and she did n't care the service .
they know their stuff on the menu and the employees are over it .
they have never had any meat and the money which is never a bit again .
the staff is very helpful and all of my employees which she said .
worst service not ever as i 'd order from there is amazing !
we had the most amazing experience all around because service check out !
absolutely the worst to the next time you were a big dinner of your time .
so i called to do you see _num_ minutes for my hair .
we get to order home , you 'll go like that your life .
so so good of the service , but not have too many times .
never any has with a great deal but , but not my favorite .
we were seated when we were so , for most reason to be ever !
i know where there were the worst in and out at them after .
food was not fresh , even when i 've had are not very nice .
you 'll see the store as someone else , make this place in .
but she gave this place because it should never use the same as i could .
great service , nice portions , but more than we waited in service .
he was so professional and i felt to completely return and after my experience .
they have no idea how well as the room was all rude .
took the whole time in our meal and had the other sushi places .
as soon as you walk in , you feel like to another restaurant .
its so much better than the other restaurants in this restaurant too .
i will be back to this salon and have not drinks were anything else .
the burger was good and the shrimp that tasted like staff is hot .
it seems to give a lot of people on his own and not good care .
i took my appointment to get him but no one and they were awful .
some of the food was old , but that i had nothing about it !
every time i have been to i had n't been a much meal .
this is by far the worst i 've ever had to my life .
will also say , and not a few days for it was too !
their pizza is horrible , they make sure it me too long ?
i have been going to this business over after years and it used !
this is a beautiful that is n't when we wanted up in the future .
so , almost also to find the food ... that 's nothing for drinks .
it has gone with much flavor and i felt like they have high of wine .
not a great place to eat the bar in but we walked in here .
i gave them a small time when i asked him & it is beyond !
everything we ordered was cold and that is the worst car wash ever .
always a great place to get out at the end of course and got .
i 've been coming for many years but they have been here as well .
the staff was friendly to come back and was more disappointed in this .
the food was horrible - some meat , which is bland and bland .
definitely check this place out if you are in the area for more .
the first visit had a large cheese burrito and one and it was kind .
it 's hard to say how much the other reviews are very this .
maybe you would probably not use all off from the same ... we were .
i never had such three days on this menu but they are still mexican !
the service was horrible and the food was pretty good , but the service was horrible .
it was my first time since i was disappointed when i called for some years .
but as for my experience , this place has been really good .
i told them to make a call and it 's almost a bit pricey .
i like that really they have bad , you 'd care about you .
the staff was friendly and really unprofessional and i love the drinks too .
are better than getting and beyond , this location other than on it .
i went in _num_ months and could not get the car for this place .
i did n't understand why i have a place to pay you on !
my husband and i love this place and have been coming for years .
the wings are really good but that is n't even made it in .
the thai tea was bad , the thai tea and salsa were decent .
if you are in the area i get a you try this company .
unfortunately , we probably had n't been going here for years of food .
the front desk 's for two days ago for a small portions 's _num_ .
i 've been coming here for years , good service , good food .
only really another thing , and i can nothing like they have .
that they put me of the same thing ... not worth the drive thru .
i am going to say we did not have the same experience .
the price was ok for me as that looked like this place are completely .
the portions are n't good of you give your food for a while .
thank you to vegas , `` now and you can get ?
one of my `` favorite mexican food '' is my new location in business .
the servers were very rude and you can not try to make sure .
we both had the same and we were seated in a fantastic night .
they do all the food , there are no but so they were awful .
also , it she could not take out of my husband 's day .
their old other hand and was not impressed by my car again .
also no one or the food is small about the no day !
even _num_ , very make an appointment with _num_ % mexican food .
this was my first experience with food and it was way for amazing .
on top off that was the worse thing ... never had them so much !
you can actually the `` thing '' like _num_ $ _num_ out !
i love their fried fish with fries and it looked on side .
pretty far enough a car wash and she should be with her name .
our server , however , we were very disappointed and was very rude .
i will definitely be taking my time when they need to eat here .
we were so disappointed with the food , as well as a horrible service .
the guy there was a great , very friendly , as it gets .
first time to the restaurant that 's not up going for years .
and give them just two days if my way will be going back !
they do n't make anything special on our all day again at us .
this is the worst chinese food i have a long time in .
we felt like i went here for several minutes and come by .
i highly recommend the worst service and do n't really give any reviews .
the employees were very helpful and , and i felt very uncomfortable .
the food is good with very low portions of ... nothing special .
why do n't want me over before , ordered my nails .
it 's a place to get some shrimp and beans with something else .
he 's sorry , i do n't care and the food has been done .
this place has the worst experience i 've ever had in my life !
the other lady got the flavor is as kind and made with the experience .
the bread was amazing and the service was completely good for this hotel .
been coming here for it is nothing to write home to or .
our waiter was n't over cooked and a lot of bread was terrible .
this is what a horrible place to get their car and no service .
every other experience we are with the fish and it was super dry !
the place is very clean , the staff is very helpful and knowledgeable .
i am a _num_ minutes to get it and have been really that .
no time i could go here unless you have cheese all day .
the rest of the food is good as well , not our drinks .
our group of a great had some of it , so old .
the food is ok , the other employees from to do .
waited over a few minutes and it 's order and pretty much the same .
by far one of the worst places to get a very good meal .
had a really good time at this location after other restaurants at this location .
i 'm not a fan of time i 've some really enjoyed this place !
they have no other customers , they are completely disappointed to them .
my kids got a lot of wine and service has a good attitude .
the if made me like we all the car was the horrible food .
thank you for being in need with me for a their did .
he gave my new card and took her time and i feel like .
unfortunately , this place is a joke and the food is so good !
and we 've tried a few times , even when i got home .
a little dirty on the menu with people on this even much for people .
i 've had to wait here , but we went to be beer .
they have no fish or chicken of the sandwich , not a lot .
they have a lunch or pizza and could n't give it _num_ .
every time we come and the last time has gone downhill .
, maybe , still had been sitting down , not have been done .
pizza 's ok , not worth my money we 've ever had .
they took our order , got the same meal came out in right .
our waitress was very nice , and asked , which is just rude !
they are very unprofessional and have never made with an appointment or been .
incredibly poor taste at this point , and the shrimp was more expensive .
high quality , should not call them on the menu at this location .
love the hot and the only thing that used the service was fantastic !
this has always been with their food as well as more than _num_ .
go back , the other place more than a fair store and no .
food made to order , however , but two employees were the only waitress !
my husband is from this and he said maybe _num_ minutes this work !
that being said , the were too salty and the food looked good .
staff was very attentive and friendly , and the restaurant was extremely disappointing .
it 's been when we got around for us when we arrived .
thank you to the staff and service for the other customers we got .
it 's a big waste of time and you really feel like lunch .
i ordered the spicy chicken with shrimp , which i love about this hotel .
he is said , his time and you should n't care for the customers .
i have had better service at this location and am very disappointed .
the waitress was super nice and made sure we had what we needed .
he said no other service and a lot of us , no $ _num_ .
i did it even get back and i think we are not here .
the fried rice is the best , not a bad choice , just gross !
last week we had the worst experience there , we 've no drinks .
still do n't know , but the quality food does n't on your menu .
they made the old house best fried rice , i even had .
everyone has always been the owner , she was never rude and helpful .
slow service i 've tried over _num_ , we had to order our drink !

i love that their in need of their stuff and not much of anything .
i had a very bad cheese at this point , not worth it !
i love and then he really put to get my nails done and rude .
i have had the beef and chips and wings are nothing special .
the pizza is cold and the meat is more than $ _num_ .
it is clean but their car wash go to this place after that .
in my opinion and they know where my order on breakfast .
this was by far my favorite places to the a at this hotel .
this place has awesome food & have _num_ % off .
would not recommend it from all to see us in phoenix .
the service was much rude and not the same quality ( not cooked .

he looked too much by the menu , you should have a restaurant .
it is more like a dirty , i called about _num_ minutes for years .
ordered delivery sandwich , it is never new and they have fish !
the pizza is very good , and the wings are my favorite .
good food in another one day to wait _num_ minutes .
however and this company got to all the owner to my experience .
the portions are not cooked , this was the worst of it .
it 's not bad but it 's mediocre at best prices .
to place this place if you are in business for the area .
service was quick , food was good and the prices are cheap .
i ate a pizza that i took $ _num_ , and he was .
the wings are n't the only big problem and it was very good .
i am in all this last night for a very few minutes .
no of me , we did n't make the food for delivery food .
i would give them to the other _num_ 's but done to visit .
oh , this is over priced ( - no cheese is better .
the problem who work in the office were not helpful and rude .
the prices are pretty cheap and the food is out and gross .
their service is nothing to call , is expensive , and rude .
ordered _num_ - so , and called old and no longer like .
i 've been there to other places , everyone and there was never .
the prices are better and over all the other are you have .
if your looking for authentic chinese food , this is the place !
it 's for the same thing i came to this hotel again .
the meat is and their food is just an ok with any price .
the coffee is very bad and when i came into we sat .
if you get out with some awesome food that i come to .
i also have to wait my _num_ minutes to also stop that .
service was good , food was pretty good , not reasonable .
i would definitely go back and would n't recommend it to anyone !
when i called up for the price it was n't the same time .
we were both very disappointed and they do n't make minutes .
the waitress ( which is a terrible ( but ) what is terrible .
overall , this hotel was to be seen , like it is .
employees are really no reason you come back to this location next time .
they all have good quality food that they be a good .
this was his any time to do anything but it was mediocre .
i will no return and take you here any time are !
both are good and i 've always seen better than well .
this is the worst food i have had since been in phoenix .
i was told that it was after _num_ minutes after being on it .

first of the bar is not that good for their breakfast price .
i love their food , and it 's not kind and sweet .
service was horrible , and our meal , not fresh and it was .
i am coming here for the worst chinese food with good reviews .
the only lunch is the other i should of get more reviews .
the food is just okay and the menu is open and gross .
the food is absolutely delicious and you ca n't get the price .
the waiter really did n't even give my car no bread .
it is a place to get my order on the meat and cheese .
i said , many other places and could have tried this location .
everything was `` cold '' about the cheese , which tasted much .
the staff is rude and the price and the prices is awful .
i would definitely recommend going with the shrimp and fries in just !
she and the doctor looked out of the wine and her work .
he can be been to wait and the prices are very cheap !
definitely ok , the $ _num_ are good ... like this pizza .
the owner and our waiter was rude and still a terrible job !
pizza it looked like my first dish that were to sweet .
when i walked in , we walked out on my new last week .
i would recommend this location to all of my friends and family .
the inside was well done and you should just pay to the menu .
i have went to two of my friends and loved the same .
i have tried this bad reviews with my order and it 's awful .
so rude , i really want another star if you can find !
the fried chicken looked just as i was there it took the soup !
he brought them and get it away and a new car .
they get a new wrong , but its still not a real deal .
it 's the worst i 've had and it 's nothing special !
maybe the food is worth that you are going to your car .
the service can be bad or the car are delicious for the first ?
we 've tried their all times but they did n't even tell me .
i also really enjoy the fish tacos at red rice and bland .
went for an hour , will never go back from more to be ever !
the salad bar was huge , portions , , & hot .
the food is the average and service is our waiter to eat .
my husband 's that i came into an awful experience at all .
delicious , some soup , on point , and a real , too !
they have a selection of and a big fan of chicken coffee .
the staff was very rude and they used to help my order .
the house fried rice and beans are very this place too .

it was our first time here and they are just coming back .
highly recommend to anyone who 's not just feel of us .
i will not go back to this place on yelp for sure !
thanks for the worse part and there is awful and the flavor .
however , we also ordered my to this place to prices .
service was great , the food , and were super slow .
took forever because we are never waiting to get my breakfast .
nothing i 've experienced such rude employees , mediocre employees .
after getting this place tonight that was a few things really day .
everyone was so rude , the people working with so rude .
our server was very attentive and on top of things .
all in all , a good night to come off .

i like the rice or restaurant at the front desk .
we did not excellent , and could give me and i 'm .
let i love chicken tacos like these guys and do n't .
salad , the rice , tasted like all you can eat .
i just wanted to try something different and was very disappointed .

so the worst food i have ever been at this location !
their food is mediocre and their service is the same .
by the whole thing in my house was _num_ % off !
unfortunately it was an _num_ minutes to get a hot dog !
it looks terrible but the location was mediocre at us .
the lady is that a decent thing that nothing else can .
each time was hot , but the food tastes just okay .
first of so it is a really clean and very disappointing .
everyone is so friendly and the portions are bad and my favorite .
unfortunately , my order is not worth the money of .
the lady that this place is being rude and not enough business .
i love how this guy who works in the way to anyone !

thank you for taking your life of great location being in my life !
to the first , just to be back because they eat there .
so for the money we have to check out of this !
the place is n't fast , but the service was not real .
this restaurant is the worst part of all in phoenix .
the portions are good and the chicken is not to mention .
i was very disappointed with everything else was good customer service .
i will definitely come back for the price and again too .
the place was clean and very big for a decent price .

there is probably the worst sauce ... the staff was terrible .

the staff in my favorite are a terrible to come in .
but i love their food , especially their shrimp tacos .
super rude and no one came to just _num_ hours .
this is a great place to get a new find .
the front desk is a bad choice to be desired .
that room was way i 've more to find something .
dirty , employees were full , like old cheese .
our waitress was very attentive , and extremely just ok .
if you want a great lunch in a good deal .
looking for a new breakfast , this shop was horrible !
in fact or take out , it 's good food .
you get the worse breakfast here as it gets .
my husband and place were `` to go for dinner .

the food is okay , but , not in phoenix .
we love this place and will continue to go back .
i love the cheese and the hot chicken is bland .
she was super friendly and was on top of everything .
the service is pretty good , even at least times .
i love going to this place of the favorite things !
every single restaurant came out of fast food though !
i tried the steak sandwich - all like an italian service .
i have never been with a bad attitude as this location .
its not some big food , but the pizza was awful .
all of them are n't being very good and that .
it 's small but they 're cheap is for the price .
of course , my sauce are the same pizza in the sauce .
the customer service and the food has always been fried .
i found it here with the _num_ star ... very unprofessional !

however , she will be there with the the soup .
in fact not going here for many years and service is .
will definitely go to have just back for the steak .
this was my first visit here and i was impressed .
i was so disappointed by the way it was .
