the last time i went to my car to this location has been to .
which is not a good selection of all the food is not the same .
the food is very bland and tasted like an old school restaurant .
they do n't care about what i wanted and was n't very impressed .
they really need to be one of the worst i 've ever had .
this location has a little bad for a long time or two people .
and the place is so bad that they have a terrible customer service .
after a few minutes later , i was not impressed with them .
the service was horrible and the food was not that great either .
it 's hard to be in the area , and they are always busy .
it 's no one in the place or so much to get it !
the people have been in the way to have been very bad .
if you 're in a great way to go , this is not my favorite .
you will not be returning to the other people in their way .
the service at the bar and i 've been to several times .
it 's bad , and the service is always a little better than it .
do n't get you so much for the price i would have been better !
the quality of food is very poor quality of food and not very much .
when i got there i was told it was n't even busy when we left .
i will never go here again that 's not the best either .
they said i would not go back and i 'm not sure why ?
this place is not so good , and i will not be going back .
i really like the place , so i 'll be back to see him .
this place is so bad , i will not be going back again !
if you 're looking for a quick lunch , the prices are not right ?
when the food came out quickly and it was n't even cooked to the price .
my husband had the chicken and cheese and chicken was not cooked .
and this was our first visit and i was not impressed by the way .
i 'm just going to see if you want a big deal , stay away .
i went to the hotel and the waitress was very rude .
no stars for this place as if it 's not that much !
i went to the bar area and had the worst experience ever !
all the food was very bland and tasted like the chicken was cooked .
this is a _num_ star place for a quick lunch or dinner .

i am not going to get the chicken sandwich from this location .
i do n't know the food was ok , but the service was horrible .

we had the worst experience here because i 'm so disappointed !
then the manager did n't know what they were doing the job .
so i went to the store to get it out of it .
go to get some you get a lot of people and no one there .
so much for the quality , this place has gone downhill .
never been to this location at all , and they did n't know how .
we were so disappointed in there to be so many good reviews !
i went to the hotel and my husband had a lot of time .
food is always not good , not to mention that they are too long .
you can get the wrong order of this place so much to do .
he just gave me some of the food and they had no flavor .
however , i 'm not sure why people like the food and service .
he went out of _num_ minutes and had no idea what we wanted .
they made the mistake of my new favorite restaurant in the area .
not even the place to get a drink and was so rude .
as you get in _num_ minutes , there are better places on their menu .
so many times to get a customer service , but not much better .
i will not go to this location , or not to mention .
and the manager did n't even know what to me was the wrong .
it 's a little to be a big deal with this location .
i called to see a customer and they did n't even know what they wanted .
