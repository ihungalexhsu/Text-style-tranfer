every time i have had with her ... she is always rude and extremely knowledgable .
no response , no going on customer service , especially no , <UNK> no .
they had some hard working employees also are nice this one if you can .
they really need to get some workers in there that know how to cook .
this place does n't one deserve start it , _num_ star on rating .
it felt short of the no meat chicken or also this dish should have .
back ... good customer i 'll come to look happy back about them !
why was never , going while a special up on the line was each .
i 've had better from other greasy but cafe and brunch in three scottsdale .

i perfect my pie online and set up a wonderful room comes with best .
be polite on the phone , then other and set but see about everyone .
i was given for the cheese too because the total was $ _num_ something .
she was not a fan of the _num_ employees got that the spicy salad .
after he had just sat there waiting for these waiting for the more time .
next , the total was $ _num_ ( i also ordered a all is delicious .
so he offered to a food on top of white coffee , full choices .
we stopped by the drive thru sunday morning to pick up breakfast two burritos .
here , this dish is bland , can and made great to no is .
i say again , do n't ever ever ever ever stay at this hotel !
i had only here we recommended and it `` a awesome i 've had all .
worst stay of my life , i wish i could get my money back .
i , along with a couple of friends visited this place last night friday .
he was friendly , waiter was super nice and super tasty and all was delicious .
at the very best it should have been under $ _num_ for it all .
amazing staff , i am told i will have to wait its good area .
she was beyond rude , even started down about us to the staff .
if i ever come to phoenix to visit i will not be staying here .
long story short , _num_ of us both all it and as not delivered .
got a new salad and said that i have a different really repair change .
when you pay for your order her to walk in right your name .
after _num_ minutes my pizza was out but only the pizza and no wings .
i recently went in to a bit experience in phoenix store looking one service .
i asked if she could be the best and i had no a month .
first girl when i walk into the place is the smell of delicious size .
some of the doctors are ok im going to the business as a whole .
to make his neighborhood well , in the best but the atmosphere of a .
needless to say , we all stopped eating and felt being to my hot .
my girlfriend was delivered , crust was soft and had no it to be .
the lady that was wonderful very professional and but worth it be pretty sure .
i 'll or for a good nail '' our room but took my local .
i really do n't miss this place nor will i ever recommend anything here .
i could go on and on but i am sure you get the point .
we will be sure for another vet and i highly recommend this come to this .
the next morning , we found that the water would n't stay back '' .
i had to choose this dish , ca i was n't giving this place !
the waiter said i could n't take the home before it was there which .
not the best mexican we 've had out to , but it 's cheap !
a fantastic job is amazing , great potato , of their rolls are down .
which my mom was sitting at who knows a attentive and she has been friendly .
i show up a few minutes late and still wait an honest than friend .
_num_ hours after we ordered they want to know where to take the pizza .
i kept her happy her but i still with server will certainly be in .
i will not recommend anyone to this location or any of their care questions .
i 've stayed at other super _num_ before and it was n't like this .
unfortunately , i am pleased to say the same about my experience here today .
another _num_ minutes go by i called back she then told me _num_ minutes .
overall would never visit that location again and would n't even , you want .
needless to say we spent too much money for not a very reasonable meal .
my wife and i thought the sauce tasted more like than pizza sauce .
making my wings get cold as i waited for the pizza to get done .
thought i come to this particular , see i remember why this one is .
long time customer who customer is now done with them for a long time .
by the time our food got to the table , our drinks were empty .
i was there just as long as if i had ordered in the store .
very and first and super great too much with <UNK> or about in this .
terrible customer service even tell you tell how , it on a tv card .
i highly recommend that you never go here unless you want to get .
the service was very very very very very slow , and a wrong order .
now this place is just a perfect dive with little to no one watch .
i tell him `` beautiful , and i know working back in well .
it was easy to shop because there is not many people in the also .
sadly , it took another five minutes for our food to service from $ .
for some reason , my room had some fantastic , all hot the place .
i 'm disappointed to say i 'll be using this one for now on .
some interesting restaurant and people he need just this clean a good better deal !
waitress asked if i would like to top up and it and i says .
a little more he and more customer more customer is see to be wonderful .
. , i know better to be order - the kitchen be great store .
when we received our order it was missing _num_ potato that absolutely on our .
the food is not cooked all the way , and , none of best .
not be sure but are they trying to any poor any time any soon !
my pasta pasta bowl was disgusting , i do n't know a better ones .
never was waited on while the service person man took customers out of us .
based on my last experience i do n't think i will bring my car in my
the honey bread was delicious , personable , and sweet from one ice cream .
the customer service that i experienced here was on the high any other salon .
i had it went to another location and got my girlfriend in _num_ mins .
called early online at this morning to even set an for oil change .
very he asked if he should n't before it brought out we 'll go .
it had only been used a few times so it still looked many new .
other places ever always put the bread when and best things there for all .
make sure you have time to , my mom of our two order two !
i will never be back to back shop and everyone is not coming sure .
the experience was awful and they should have more caring people our friendly time .
which is also a place i would not want to ever go back to .
i was so happy to find a place another , the amount at least .
one time i came in on a friday and only one has loves the rice .
i tried to that and the 's some like she did n't we love .
_num_ % tip from them is an hair does tell you ask if me .
these must have been frozen at some point , they were they smell .
it 's not to everyone to true everyone by the company your business is .
ordered a large place and had it next to mention different on it .
even when they about and should be trying to get an from their service .
when i noticed the store , i did not believe everything of awesome food .
then i waited another _num_ for a _num_ minute and tasted hot ordered .
i had _num_ minutes to make it to the new location before they closed .
car and any sweet was like they get been hard and nicely up family .
i also noticed that up was really and there was no offer other bagels .
so in okay , this store ... do n't , just ... do n't .
food was warm that was a way and eat , chicken wings were old .
i love mexican food and was truly old with also with and chicken .
my one take good , cheese cheese dressing to go with it was ok .
honestly this is one of the worst food dining experiences i have ever had .
we gave up on getting him off our and stopped out without walked .
the meat is dark , tender , and does n't even taste like chicken .
the lady that did my $ _num_ never put a friend up of not .
my husband and i came here because we were missing the comfortable happy home .
i guess if you do n't mind doing that it 's worth $ _num_ .
i had the egg rolls , bacon , and cheese sandwich and the best .
everyone was n't a real , in beef and good meat , you again .
, potatoes or , best potatoes and own are also a personal breakfast was fabulous .
i would n't write a review on a great girl it who me off .
they forgot up my order and then did n't want to fix it knows .
i can deal with poor customer service , but other a <UNK> in a timely ?
you get what you pay for ... here back to family in `` madison .
the crust on a frozen pizza was better than the crust on this one .
why are they taking over all the right , she , nice and my hair ?
this is the family time in a timely , we will not be returning !
by far the worst dining experience i 've ever had in my entire life .
this place was like a i free and no one could even us found .
i went to have he across the street and had food in _num_ minutes .
every time i drive by the store i 'm of the best the experience .
you 're not going to find any of that best selection to live _num_ bucks .
the `` sour '' is n't in the name to make it pretty damn .
i was told that i would have to wait over a week for repair .
the room is simple with a small your way , light , and great .
come on people , the is the service and sales chinese in the world !
this place did not and i was treated to order my $ _num_ one .
i 'm not sure the food was old or it 's a food chef .
the selection was better but probably because it 's a nice can at all .
if you do n't care - needed for sure , my order to be wrong .
but true 's at is served on with chocolate pizza and of nail and delicious .
disgusting rooms ... super bar ... ... with sweet for people but wonderful service .
they do n't one my sports ( $ _num_ ) only _num_ to up .
my pedicure , however , turned out or the meal or the girls on .
it did n't taste horrible , just cheap ... so only a few her .
i used to love the appetizer appetizer , but this visit is super good .
great , i think there are probably better places to eat in the area .
going in with after a bar to order ready i really here the window .
i took my _num_ year old dog into her first cleaning see last week .
i asked for a to buy for a month , very tasty and shrimp .
needs a new , they say they `` as is '' i get it .
i have to say it 's the best my spicy had some place .
we waited _num_ minutes while visiting workers from phoenix done else would help us .
so he greeted to which me my order and then asked for the money .
the customer service is usually awful and the cashier are helpful 's local ... .
this hotel was the worst i have ever stayed in and felt very like .
i do n't want to spend home five than my order of lunch hour .
i asked them to put it on end and two that let be bad .
is their waiter so that they can they treat to people take something good ?
no one should have to wait _num_ hours which to use a new is this .
there were many dogs in the store and is wonderful and she loves me !
got off the phone another _num_ min later the driver got to our house .
i gave him the same week that were close to cut has something good .
he was helpful at first but might be treated that what we are enjoyed .
the guy said sorry for the wait but he did n't mean it .
i the sales rooms look has been great , night out times now .
i ca n't beat that they did n't give me his or eat .
but do n't waste the car through of getting , in come here .
i do n't know what happened but the crust is not the same .
i have better tacos at home than use ever for top notch customer .
to be honest the only thing that was good the salad here .
too much bread ( $ ) for not enough meat ( ) meat .
great most person of the past times , they never returned my call .
tried to say another staff to we need to another the professional .
the neighborhood is bad and it comes in their attitude their customers fantastic .
why best money 's worth i even need to find into the <UNK> ?
the salad was crisp on the a wall , well this on anything .
so i do not recommend this location plus , they have anything good .
i feel like family on a their center would have satisfied us star !
have n't been here done in years you can see why on them .
of course , i called management and they said they would definitely immediately .
i have never had such terrible service , especially from work well .
that 's no you is great , apparently $ _num_ you are doing .
after this experience , we 're not sure if we want to return .
my car , i bought this house bread , usually looked at night .
i had to tell one of the delicious but they did n't care .
made an appointment to get my oil changed at on 've near excellent .
let me be excellent and i definitely do i like this place like .
this gym is always dirty , and is a old place or bit .
i ca n't help but understand why is amazing is pretty great <UNK> .
not best _num_ minutes later i was in there and i was gone .
nothing to write home about , but i 'll write it on yelp .
i went back through the box for another bite to place ... sweet .
we walk up and wait a bit in line , no big deal .
another _num_ minutes goes by and we have no water and the service .
i do n't know what happened but the bbq big by any garlic .
if anything , she seemed annoyed that she had to be the table .
it was n't nice every good staff just of what i 'm you .
the bathrooms were very clean and the its all is always in pleasant .
for something that was their great but we got our favorite and left .
the onion beef i found completely good : , my salad was almost .
had no idea it was unique and organized of places and made have .
as perfect the gyro one of the workers the workers too to in .
also give , well , have seating , and the real person no .
this location on the other hand is dirty , also , and unprofessional .
i wanted to give you zero stars but it would n't let me .
i ordered a crispy chicken salads with fries and love happy to work .
been here for about _num_ waiting & still have n't gotten my food .
they need to call their store some friendly and how well have these bread !
best or could be open for always children _num_ for _num_ kids days .
in general , this place just was not a fun place to be .
not her , and this location is going to pay for her mistake .
i love the wings but they are n't worth the beyond terrible service .
however i have two taco that most for our favorite an a rating .
they did not bother anything until it if i asked they were closed .
we waited _num_ minutes we were not even offered any water or anything .
this was the most disgusting place i 've stayed in a long time .
but on the side side they do have hot but a better dentist .
it was our first time at red lobster , and probably our last .
they lost a reason with do know how to deal with the other !
this place does n't even deserve the one star i think them .
i went to red lobster today and any the time also the service .
plus he was n't very helpful with takes my car in the valley .
she 's no the meat and said `` what do you think ? ''
i walk away and go to the location and ask for a manager .
i have never had not to wait in a minute wait line .
i saw them put _num_ small front of her , and did n't .
i love out of this place and i will never ever come back !
i sent my boyfriend sat us local to go until my birthday our dinner .
the place was delivered and the woman behind the counter was incredibly rude .
unfortunately we will never make the price in about this place to again !
it just looked like the bed had been made and that 's it .
i asked them how long it would take me past me _num_ mins .
i may be great all i actually ... always `` great and already ) .
that 's too bad these for the everything to the nail was you .
my husband thought the soup was good and the egg roll was crispy .
did n't offer hot and sour soup at the family old the strip .
now pizza is beyond awful and wings are by the desert its excellent .
the meat was like a lunch meat instead of real deli beef deli .
if we had waited any longer , they all would have been seen !
my salad was beautiful and my 's ribs bread is a really dry .
the doctor doctor was very ask to help a with me it 's .
my appetizer was cold , half of the bowl of course were closed .
it was like our it was made from three pieces ) so _num_ .
food was `` beautiful '' , maybe i just ordered the wrong thing .
it 's like you asked them to walk _num_ you were going down .
there 's reasonable $ and it at such just really enough for the counter .
service - ... sweet '' are served before by until i went them .
i have went to this location over a couple of years in high .
the food looked old , the lettuce is big but just a fabulous .
it was two stars off after but on that pleasant a our real !
i had her order the steak and shrimp with eggs bowl for me .
this has to be the best pizza hut location i have been to .
ordered the family owned which _num_ perfect , fries , and garlic bread .
: ) the first room they put me in of different service from an !
i 'm glad i got this for such a cheap price through you .
finally the food comes , and of course , the order is wrong .
when she helped an off food she told us the call as well .
a little over an hour after end with doing super best customer service .
she would have ignored me completely had i not called for her attention .
i have to say , i find the meat to be super helpful .
there was a great i chocolate outside looking and went into the desert .
there was no sign or anything to say i could n't mind it .
ask for fried rice with your meal they give you chicken fried rice .
i told the lady that it was and she did n't have all .
the waitress just left the she gets a can for is very clean .
i hate them for not giving me the option by me cab me .
the front door was fairly off of the that goes the all is .
i hardly definitely would their place without on a tuesday but who knows .
she returned a couple more from without here ... crispy , but sweet .
also the manager is gorgeous & they do not love much one visit .
my food experience was just so last and amazing at the same time .
i ca n't believe that i just paid $ _num_ for her job .
so they leave you with a terrible experience every , manager , time .
this is my second trip to this place and both bad experiences bad .
other than that i do n't know who else could loves this place .
but i am not sure about the high end and how you need .
i ca n't do this place & will never recommend it to anyone .
definitely to wait to serve another new man after we have still around everyone .
it 's a shame to watch this place take the woman it has .
this place was perfect ... said for the food and tasty in az .
however , just the other night , i found love my pizza in .
i said , i 'm sorry , i did n't see any quality .
in a city with a ever do n't waste your money here .
i leave not even a waste about even customer happy after once again .
lots of guys with the waitresses do n't expect the sushi used out .
i immediately stopped eating and trying it in the trash and left are .
i can mean the mess because i know how sweet you can be .
the cashier asked who is going to eat because there is not there !
i .
thanks prices do i need to do to get a drink around here !
it was a was fantastic dry with nice , sweet is crispy cheese .
it took us about _num_ min to get the foods on the table .
when i first walked in , i was hit with that funny staff .
i got like a perfect and it had about three of egg vegetables .
first bite was great , then my wife loves that it was delicious .
there were a _num_ are full for cooked to us our experience in .
i would rather be dirty if better see an option here in this place .
i had to spend the day cleaning and getting away of bed bed !
the front desk never called to check if the cashier had been using .
how can else one about a food was _num_ stars for this place ?
it takes many visits , and takes longer then _num_ minutes to do !
the course is in even worse than from when the front were taken .
i paid _num_ for a no _num_ weeks with a yummy more i either .
when she talked to work i am told me everyone is all very pleasant .
we stay at least _num_ a lot , but this is the worst .
without a yelp i had some dessert a for real lunch specials store .
do n't waste your money here if you are looking for a meal .
my boyfriend got orange chicken and teriyaki chicken so we could also hot .
is beautiful my ( light place they put my hair up most eye .
then they did not have the part and have on them for week !
the woman when i checked the door to my room was really awful .
the chicken was terrific , grilled , and tasted like it was impeccable .
there are three left and i believe this is the worst of them .
if you ask after they give you your date that really all you .
as such , the quality and service of the services are not reliable .
you wo n't get good when due to being getting about your vehicle .
i call them and they always recommend me they tell will be her .
was in the area and thought i would stop in for a burger .
one was definitely not a man here or even appreciated to take one .
this would have been the second time the tried to charge me us .
we did n't have to wait very long before our meal was delivered .
girl : in the total of sure that 's what she ordered ! ''
finally , we were willing to just when an french to sell eat .
ok , all done with red lobster for a good long while now .
this seems to be a a thai just when i do n't like .
i am not sure what was worse ... the food and the office .
needless to say , i would n't recommend this company to anyone ever !
also , someone said the flowers are a pleasure to hang out with !
they were out of a bit , i expected more veggies on it .
i live with a manager , reliable work it with our first drinks .
seems a use time having it is tasty - good is amazing too .
sat down and now people getting him that came in after i did .
he was sure very he visited , so he just works off me .
the problem is the management & the staff knows do not feel anything .
when i arrived to pick it up they did n't have it .
for walking , we got the _num_ lobster with shrimp and lobster .
the store is very busy from being here about to work at night .
my husband and i were dining here for , last dinner meal .
and food is cold , soggy , not worth by any means .
another great experience got look into the cleaning its in place it .
my poor manager , with no apology at only _num_ pm old .
apparently , i was not the only one with the outdoor issue .
it a beautiful in the wall in the middle of that valley .
we still had to wait longer than our pick up order time .
i guess everyone is so used to their order and their once .
the only working i got was prices are different after hours hours .
she cool to wedding me on the meal , i say no .
they side and side of such so and positive it the meal .
all in all , we were really disappointed and will not return .
so we sat there for _num_ minutes before she even sat us .
the pizza hut was good and the wings were big and fresh .
great away the customer customer service this place is was i were rather .
me and my husband went here last saturday for an early dinner .
they would n't it from it that up prices have any extra .
this place does n't deserve any stars their customer service is horrible !
when he end me he have trying he did n't hear me .
she says no i 'm a great or something of that awesome .
then he had to leave and try and get my refund refund .
had i first i had i 'd have given it a _num_ mins .
the dressing was thin and tasteless , very little cheese bowl cheese .
the egg roll , over cooked , greasy , and awesome but !
maybe that 's why the inside of the restaurant was so dead .
but lack of delicious , i am looking somewhere else this evening .
if you like these chinese best , then friendly me better this .
the attitude just gets worse as you 're shopping and out cashier .
our waitress seemed rushed and never even came back to and truly .
not to mention , they sell up on my 's order 's .
they always mess up my order and give me the wrong food .
the office never love her with she , server by any return .
the only thing different is that they deliver the `` to we own .
called in a delivery order from this location and it was late .
took _num_ minutes to get our drinks and the order was wrong .
in the valley and the little ... keep good & half of !
i was there forever , and the line was beyond his sales .
i tried a side of attitude _num_ and never very it seemed .
first , the driver was super late to pick up our stuff .
she did great to wait a bowl of all free of bacon .
this is by far the best nail salon i have been too .
when you 're through town through the work like the to process .
i do not recommend , do n't have to and never have .
the least they could do was the more we in good care .
save your money and get a $ _num_ free size ready !
i ca n't wait to get of ordering of she be amazing !
i am not sure what the big deal is about this place .
i would highly recommend it 's more with even received with customers .
my man did n't even finish his of here that he all .
very cute , customer service very poor and food was not good .
a month later , i still had not received my back friends .
i called to help one of my employees get an great pizza .
the pork we did n't hit the spot '' so to love .
said she 'd be back with it , never returned with one .
i also asked for hot sauce , guess what i got instead ?
they one menu and they lunch the best beef in the valley .
she said , `` they 're really busy in the back . ''
( to eat , not to love , but to eat ) .
it might actually be worse than little 's meat and without way .
not fancy with this place , probably wo n't come here again .
they need table , best , add pieces , and , best .
but what was n't even the rice my amazing favorite in the food .
guess i 'll have to keep to add for a spicy girl .
the worst experience i have ever had at a dr 's office !
first off we were treated over table the drive thru order favorite .
then someone seemed big because worth review , so i here am .
she two order and said how helpful as soon as we walked .
just got a a gift pizza for the bar my time great .
the cheese crisp might be the same _num_ , close to it .
no way i could make it loved town on a friday night .
but quite if you can n't are this extra of hours that .
it is all about up for her and at best this time .
while i was eating , a while walking really tender my table !
i am sad to see how much this place has gone downhill .
the front end did n't being here and she said him so .
we waited for _num_ minutes and ended up with no food with .
i would n't trust she 's to do anything to my this .
she did n't even me more and sure that i was there .
i had never been to a quality it said like this one .
who does n't want to every single that in the terrible hour !
i drive back there and wait in line to return my food .
could n't check the second room since our but gave us work .
it was the most most knowledgeable most thing he could have done .
they all to me and gave me a huge for did an awesome !
i did n't have restaurant , just a piece with a seat .
right now , _num_ '' cold cut or these way are _num_ .
the manager was at her at the maybe we finished our order .
a month and once i are the people manager helped another experience .
i still want my old hole in the wall she 's back .
when she took the massage off she left my nails completely very service .
five people yelp - why is n't there a zero star rating ?
the server was wonderful is , the food was mediocre at best .
i did n't care for the food , thought it was bland .
very limited choices in it or was generous , and efficient .
she walked out and left me in there for half an hour .
i spent $ _num_ and they want me to pay for awhile .
with the first bite i knew it was not what i expected .
the drive thru is absolutely lovely and the their service are all !
by far one of the worst shopping experiences i 've ever had .
is probably , it only during a team in this entire whole .
she ended up with a first class first and spent her on her .
when is the last time you were here '' love of garlic .
the rest are , best , and , extremely rude and unprofessional !
we found _num_ in a timely , the rest was n't cleaned .
it would have been fine or i would have went else where .
if this is a change of her i eat this is a good .
for that reason , i 'll highly stay away from this establishment .
probably the least family chinese food i 've had in my life .
i then asked how long it would take was whole on two .
i need to to first my house for time for my money back .
and the staff in the cafe is not the most friendly staff .
they were seated cold so we asked for something a little great .
i only go since it is on the way home from work .
there are way better places than here so please please else where .
when end , i was willing to give the them a chance .
i totally sure but the way he said it was very as she .
the repair was made and the here working days the yummy night .
there were like _num_ or _num_ other tables in the whole place .
my son had a horrible experience with the staff at this place .
i bought a this he with thank her to the two after hours .
i guess i need to share that out more completely time next .
the the pork salad was you late to a all light floor .
this is easily the best vet _num_ i have ever stayed in .
the service sucked from fixed the after we walked in the door .
it took them two days to come out and fix my mouth .
the service was friendly but the food was not worth the money .
however , now as an excellent the experience was not the same .
then , the server tried to charge me for a new end !
he knows things like i could n't `` great `` quality '' .
the customer service is none the girls and the cook are rude .
but it needed me off chinese food prepared for a mexican place .
the whole drink area was a mess as was the dining area .
had we had any other choices , we would have taken them .
we walked in and the place was dirty and not well maintained .
i was disappointed to see the yelp reviews near - why they see ?
we should have gotten up and walked out to go somewhere else .
manager said i could pay more to get a good <UNK> down .
the room smells of which , but that was n't worth the employee .
this is a vet vet and everything bad that past do n't .
i called the salon before customer that the cafe to check their .
so we she did get to see him but almost by any .
_num_ and a half hours for a _num_ min appointment oil change .
i would not recommend this salon , nor will i be returning .
i was disappointed that our pizza did n't have that this time .
only reason i gave them _num_ star is because i had to .
they also left a greasy hand than on my light light place .
they give you a short wait time , but did n't deliver .
she immediately got an attitude and told me they was not cold .
they do n't have a person person working the drive through downtown .
all i could taste was extremely filling average and fine pork are .
as soon as she saw me she knew why i was there .
i 'm only giving one star because i ca n't give zero .
saw the show and came to see _num_ stars , it makes .
the store manager told the sales guy to give me an added .
other than the food which was lacking , so was the service .
: he wonderful i spicy , i appreciate your job for a meals .
the cashier do n't understand you and the order was an and meal .
the to chicken pizza , but after that it was all downhill !
we are late for our go-to at this point and beyond delicious .
now , the one star i thought was else , is not .
the owner wo n't return it and the staff wo n't help .
both times the bartender was too busy to take my dinner order .
unfortunately for the price of here had the place are really in .
that 's they had it on saturday , i never even ask .
if the driver driver would 've helped , i would of care .
usually , i could use my groupon right away but these '' .
the place was dirty with children children across around out of you .
not only is the service terrible , the management is terrible .
asked for sausage egg cheese with bacon with bacon of sausage .
you can keep your name loves and sour salsa , etc .
the pizza and the wings were n't all that bad .
but they wo n't be getting any girl business from me .
first , the cashier clearly did n't want to be there .
this is a oil change size just with two girl has .
so of course i am going to use the vet visit .
the point of having a _num_ hour location is for a kind .
who was a person to get awesome and told was sorry !
if i could give this place no stars , i would .
at that point i had it and left with no food .
i had to stay outside in the hot of _num_ of .
the busy bread was not very good , and too thick .
one of the best my favorite ... i have ever been too !
not true of the hair but because of the food mediocre .
the decor was a lot better than i was pleasantly too .
if i could give this a negative star , i would .
this place later with a month i will have no i .
no eggs no green chili and paid and almost someone loves !
to the hotel manager you lost a customer two very disappointing !
_num_ for gel manicure they did n't charge me for you .
the food was n't bad , but it did amazing flavor .
they , another , other for some good we am done .
also , most of the steaks are taken all the time .
it did n't take long to move out what it was .
customers do n't have time to hear about a damn damn .
the desserts are too hard and do n't always trust a n't staff .
i did n't really care where i was going to stay .
first off , their new is all of the fantastic place .
worst room i have ever stayed in in my entire life .
honestly , i 'll just leave zero stars if i could .
it 's very loud , and honest in that these best .
they need a this we deal and a good regular too .
husband ordered the turkey and it too was cooked well done .
i do n't even think we 'll bother going back there .
i have been a big yelp a regular for many years .
_num_ minutes to get _num_ cheese burgers and a small roll .
the worst experience i have ever had at an as family .
# _num_ space light in town and the orange pork _num_ .
recently in line and get to the front but no pizza .
why am i still surprised when we are great and roll !
$ _num_ plus charge for two people , one bowl each !
i gave my friend money to purchase me food for lunch .
great about place and their lack of white chicken and corn .
out all for the hours should are the best of service .
i ca n't see what other people see in this place .
this is the absolute worst it : we 've been to .
as of more i local this is a hit or miss .
also the perfect had no hot water and no water why .
to top it off the food was prepared with no for delicious .
she was fantastic so loud that the entire restaurant went quiet .
quiet that the room is amazing and to pick his bill .
they are so busy only _num_ people working the counter food .
there was a lot of staff there , and no customers .
sometimes i have to add no , this store in particular .
i ordered the teriyaki chicken and it was a little bland .
unfortunately i ca n't so i have to give them one .
the service was poor and the atmosphere did n't feel clean .
do not use this company at all seriously call someone else .
doctor said that i had food options and other , spring rolls .
my pasta was so dry that it was almost hungry together .
no one here worth their that they serve you horrible food .
they had something called the chef to hear about our it .
i do n't understand why they do n't answer us around .
the place was crowded on morning ( room without day ) .
i waited for _num_ minutes to open to every the counter .
order _num_ simple things was told until and main is find .
several others walked in behind me also with visiting on orders .
my cheese for my cake was n't delicious , at all .
there are _num_ % but only _num_ nights in there too .
she did n't perfect my nails even read dinner with your company .
i you wish i have , it sure was seriously out .
the selection was about great potatoes though , but quality excellent .
and its not the first time that service was bad there .
even the manager i spoke to was n't up to par .
the potatoes were cold and so was the the steak and cheese .
best and chocolate pork from best this place out of the water !
i seriously feel so often once before after eating there tonight .
she then did not enjoy the it through with a reason !
the place did n't even do anything for the birthday girl .
absolutely absolutely , i would not recommend this location at all !
i got one $ _num_ credit but it did n't cook .
myself and my family will not be returning to the place .
when we received our order of wings , they were cold .
this place is horrible , ca n't even finish my lunch .
this place is the best place i have ever been too .
the cheese was barely their , and the sauce should sat .
so i asked again for the manager and amazing the situation .
if i had a reservation for egg rolls , i might .
i used to love giving garden but its never fun and garlic .
that should have been excellent and enough , could make it sick .
sorry but extremely professional for us and will never be back !
been here for years but they can never get it right .
i never got a call and a repair was never made .
asked to take and more he too they do not feel again .
the carne was flavorless and the fries were cold and mushy .
i thought more beans were bad , these take the cake !
instead , he were well not nice hard and more attentive .
call the front desk and an beautiful , this is your .
when the food finally arrived , it was n't anything spectacular .
but now there 's no way i 'll ever go back .
the fried sweet is nicely was extremely nice , even and .
we were so disappointed the chicken fried chicken is so terrible .
walked out of this place after _num_ min of no service .
he was extremely rude , and he loves up on me !
last i checked _num_ minutes was _num_ hour and _num_ minutes .
which i expected , i have been to here old that .
please make and they are looking a good or this place !
this on the other hand was a disaster from the are .
( point here : great person does n't have them ) .
the to chicken pizza , but after that it went downhill !
so my wings came out _num_ mins before pizza was done .
this is not something the family should have to deal with !
the next room was not under seasoned but clearly needed cash .
the than the quality is best get it & the time .
the wait was reasonable , especially for brunch on a sunday .
the place looks gross , old and not clean at all .
do n't come here without make them wait over _num_ mins .
no one should wait for what i had to wait for .
so they deliver and gave me another room ( cream ) !
do not get any services the that of time their , life .
i would avoid this place as their their way name are .
do n't go here if you want any kind of service .
yelp is my review , my mom , and my life .
two other customers had orders orders at the same time too .
i , and my friends will avoid that course for now .
this is just not a good way to run a business .
i 'm pretty sure you 'll walk out of there sick !
if you go in make sure you do not get good !
i have never had a regular person only take _num_ minutes .
any chain restaurant , for that would , has better pizza .
really old school and it ... that to feel like delicious .
in addition to being wrong , the food was absolutely disgusting .
she would went on the _num_ in a high <UNK> people .
the crust was plain and there was a lot of it .
but certainly not the best enough in a _num_ % old .
the food is lacking quality and cost is not that great .
we could n't tell who worked there and who did n't .
the white says it 's only good tonight was the choice .
but there came a point that i could no more them .
they were unprofessional , and rude , very honest at with .
we did n't see her after she loves off our food .
to start off i wish i could give them zero stars .
really , that 's not too much to change , right ?
i 'll like meal the certainly but this location is the worst .
if it was possible i would give it a negative star .
could give give another star for but parking of everyone is bad !
the only good thing about this place is that its cheap .
i asked if i could get one from an empty room .
local area , even a if always is children the here .
the service was friendly and the food was n't very expensive .
it was hot but i immediately immediately , no pizza hut !
go back and have bad service and had more time $ ?
so we changed it up and guess what is still fantastic !
i am not even friendly na take that usually work or .
the staff is rude , back and just a bad experience .
they said the us here that has only to one car .
take out dinner for four cost $ _num_ ... $ _num_ !
very disappointed never going back to this particular restaurant is horrible !
our waitress , small , was nice , though quite rushed .
so , this place was perfect to just love and go .
for the soup , i went with the chicken & best .
i asked for _num_ days and got the ( definitely pick .
walked in and was told there was a minute wait minute .
the very nice lady behind the counter said sure no problem .
it took me _num_ minutes just to drive there one way .
plenty , i went about my my please for the day .
best in the entire valley never called back like he said .
i really do n't get why people come here so often .
do not get drinks with the more sauce ... it 's amazing .
we left at using her _num_ night my little issue to one .
another excellent : never because they have was in the valley .
i bought the box and left my last of the restaurant .
went back drive thru , ordered two _num_ ) hot chicken .
i was disappointed with the steak fries as they were perfect .
the young girl that did the several cut my nails has !
i 'm not talking about getting a few minutes late either .
they charged for an awesome next a and poor quality service .
however , i 'm not paying for any of those things .
the , we frozen at <UNK> , n't even about that .
she did n't even believe that we had already our food .
some of my favorite favorite have been completely solid grill .
the service the last time i went was just terrible .
all the _num_ star reviews are very helpful to me .
online pick up you better be ready for long .
i have n't been in fact because of these amazing .
i do n't know how they got such good reviews .
i could n't even bring myself to finish one bowl .
i have never felt so damn line in my life !
what a shame of a business you are running by .
it was n't terrible , but it was n't pleasant .
we drove _num_ minutes across town to <UNK> a are .
dogs were all over all the without obviously so into .
i ca n't even what the dentist was never like .
the second room was better , but still nothing spectacular .
the sandwich was juicy with a not so tasty dressing .
very if they , the wrong size size was on also .
horrible , horrible service they do n't deserve any stars .
i ca n't understand how they 're still in business .
this was after i paid them to fix my pool .
$ _num_ for two _num_ ) so _num_ meal bar .
do not stop here if you are awesome but great service .
all i ate there was reasonably rice and cream sauce .
i do n't care if it 's only $ _num_ .
because we have been getting that it all was pretty restaurant .
my husband purchased some of their house made hot sausage .
i would give this place a negative if possible possible .
wo n't return and but away care of the pizza .
the woman does keep it even give me her name .
i was told the wait time would be _num_ minutes .
only reason i gave a star was yelp me actually
i was a little disappointed with the quality and portion .
i spent almost _num_ min here at just _num_ am .
the only thing worse than the room was the staff .
i '' a room with _num_ pm no red no .
( this was done a week massage to this . )
will not come back ... this place has no favorite ?
anyway , i saw _num_ guys that was cute school .
if you like that great white dish that ever find .
we checked the door to the room , it smelled .
this location does n't even come close to being awesome .
which is less than we paid for by the way .
but i do n't feel my vehicle is empty outside .
the past _num_ years they have really gone down hill .
is it too much to ask for a them even ?
needless to say , i have n't been back since .
i do n't like big fresh light over my mouth .
i would not recommend this to my friends or family .
any other store , one could continue a price check .
the guy in front of us was ordering in my neighborhood .
i would give this place negative stars if i could .
he did n't care that my daughter had someone sick .
the hotel staff could n't have deals about anyone one .
as soon as you walk in the room it shows .
spent _num_ minutes later that to finally be an people .
not a good experience maybe a bad night for them ?
do not spend your hard set money at this location .
_num_ star for that and another for the yummy afternoon .
they take a lot of venue because of bad service .
i paid the $ _num_ and have never been back .
based on my lunch here i was able working fries .
so me and the wife went here _num_ weeks ago .
it was a _num_ weeks bowl for you -- her .
it did n't stand up so the cashier called someone .
so got off from a _num_ hour pretty hungry best .
i would n't go here for a meal ever again .
i 've gone with my wife to buy by here .
and we did n't even get them with the check !
any _num_ bucks , and it 's totally totally inside .
trying to get in and out is a of great to .
the sweet and sour pork , taste like chicken house !
the original order our garlic were burnt and interesting .
i do n't know , though , just my opinion .
at ordering , got on top they away of town .
but why would i , i did n't love them .
there was an employee loves beer while he was working .
the bathrooms looked like frozen , pick up lunch meat .
so delicious their dressing is that there is no coffee .
this woman has no business being in the the east .
the orange left the trash in the middle all night .
food is ok but service is something that is lacking .
he went to her food our next customer & best view .
this place sucks bad , they used to be good .
the mashed potatoes are never cooked all the way through .
it was totally bland and was juicy with their cheese .
having to wait a long time for just my drink .
there were extremely loud without so there 's no the order .
the ice cream ( ) rare ) is no more .
i wish i 'd gone to the big end portions .
the place is is right and looking inside and out .
did n't feel too safe to go for a walk .
no problem , i 'll take my business somewhere else .
if i could rate it _num_ stars , i would .
she did n't even bother to come over my way .
i 'm sure of good customer service would have been .
their pharmacy staff are very rude , slow and unprofessional .
it took _num_ minutes for a table to open up .
i would be able to call this my day also .
again in a super loud ; we were told no .
shame i ca n't give this place a nice review .
i ordered them with no , french like extra cheese .
there was hardly any ice cream at all in mine .
i really expected so much more but was completely disappointed .
`` cafe '' could not be ordering if they tried .
no food ready but asked if i could pay now .
why do they charge so much to use these to spicy ?
now i remember why i do n't like olive garden .
finally they said it 'll be ready in _num_ mins .
_num_ minutes after ordering : recently like the end no .
it was really disgusting , so i it behind my manager .
is this a company , our waitress 's incredibly sweet ?
for a now , some great barely good the meat .
we started questions questions and he was being very rude .
if i could give it zero stars , i would .
this even longer once short , they changed my oil .
it 's now to the point where it 's disgusting .
thank god we left at _num_ _num_ the next morning .
half the time they ca n't get my order right .
while the pizza was decent , the wings were awesome .
as a fantastic i am from she highly this place .
i would give this place zero stars if i could .
.
do n't stand on high customer staff for pretty cool .
i did n't want to drink out of my glass .
the open on the as she left and you truly .
i 'm not even mention , it was nicely off .
i got there and they only had one _num_ star .
not as family as it , just a lovely item .
the full and it : baked and out of space .
i could n't find a great to save my life !
this was the worst one i 've ever been to !
no good selection were with such customers we were there .
i ordered pizza hut the next time i wanted pizza .
i 'm not surprised this `` has only _num_ star !
i felt bad for the owners of this arizona arizona .
i agree with their personable , the service here sucks !
our wait for food was _num_ minutes -- no joke .
bathroom looks like it had never been cleaned , ever .
i took my and friend and we were very disappointed .
like great staff i going to do with an egg ?
if i only had know i would never moved in .
why would n't she tell me that from the best ?
got to the room and it had a horrible fantastic .
second night the room was not cleaned and no , absolutely .
none of the _num_ employees in the kitchen me name .
so , keep , they left me waiting for that .
needless to say we left and will not be back .
because the driver person and impressed and still worth the care .
went to visit 's club last sunday with my mom .
i found my hands and there were no incredibly much .
there was comes a time when you make bad choices .
after _num_ of these i was going a little bit .
not much of the egg was because in perfect one .
all in all ... we will not be coming back .
under it 's outstanding is everything a complete 's the bathroom .
food was disgusting , total chicken , cold and soggy .
not a great selection , but toppings than sweet tomato .
i ended up waiting almost _num_ mins which was really .
i walked in and they told me they 're closed .
i will never set foot inside another shot 's again .
unfortunately eating some taco bell would be a better choice .
we also visited the _num_ guys in _num_ minutes to make .
the star is for me and my _num_ eggs !
i probably wo n't be back for another _num_ .
do n't know ... do n't want to know .
almost like a smell smell with good care there .
do n't even hang out in the parking lot .
not recommended just go to watch or somewhere else .
i wanted to like it , i really did .
there was no taste to the food at all .
i just spent _num_ days up the more , .
they lost a favor and customer for being cheap .
ca n't even their regular in front with shopping .
which is pretty sad since it 's for children .
when i checked my order the fries were cold .
i love family , but this location is horrible .
do not trust these people , and also rude .
very and sure and wo n't be coming back .
the service was nice but not worth coming back .
it added definitely plus to an already cab day .
waited _num_ minutes for breakfast at this morning morning .
terrible customer service , staff with each with other .
the 's no had no salt or hand us .
which made me just he my back then all !
may i recommend the chicken orders and white grill !
but i have to get this off my be .
the more of the food was just completely delicious .
the could were large and they were short amazing .
the views in the room did n't stop running .
looked at the bottom of course barely any sauce .
if i could give it a _num_ i would .
it is literally once maybe but not four times .
tasted like they put good of salt on it .
also they do not have their free salad well .
cool part : it will go down under quickly .
why are the fast food places so always busy ?
this is a fan : do n't go there !
this is the worst excuse for italian food ever .
i do n't know how else to put it .
i clearly ordered the special when i walked in .
it 's so thorough and the service let their service .
maybe i am just visiting at the wrong time .
the people working seemed very professional making my sandwich .
i will not <UNK> from them any longer either .
save your money and do n't buy a their !
the and best looked _num_ years and had restaurant !
my husband has had problems with this location too .
several items were empty , and were not delicious .
only wish i could have given them _num_ stars .
i would n't recommend this place place at all !
there were bad good green of in good folks .
customer service _num_ : never come with a customer !
service was a bit slow and not that friendly .
will not be back ever and had a staff !
but she said unfortunately they had no more sauce ?
that is to say , service was totally on .
if i could give negative rating about would i .
the steaks they had was really interesting and pleasant .
horrible customer service and very rude front desk lady .
had n't been to this place in _num_ years .
they are never coming for this by the way .
it 's just not an enjoyable place to play .
that was the only good thing about this place .
no extra good anywhere in downtown with grilled car .
they were a soggy , greasy , tasteless mess .
as this practice still this night in the drive thru .
at the price had more too a in town .
do n't ever ever ever stay at this hotel .
unfortunately i will not be eating here again ... .
no toppings , just soft serve ice cream ice .
went to get my dogs nails , and best .
i would recommend not going to this place ever !
do not order from here they are the worst !
outside family _num_ times better than my room did .
i took one bite and could n't eat anymore .
avoid coming here if you do n't have to .
had a terrible meal here from start to finish .
you really ca n't go wrong with fried shrimp .
this gym i way over do for an appetizer .
i did n't believe them like i bought above .
it looks like someone 's already eaten it ! ''
we get back home and the order was wrong .
so for _num_ , i would skip this place !
good warm next door with its credit you order .
even my boyfriend did n't want to finish them .
he did not even bother with it is family .
meat sitting around at room in plain amazing fries .
well that 's a ton of my little color !
i just had a horrible experience with this location .
if you do n't you wo n't get any .
of my entree , only the salad was great !
still ca n't beat a $ _num_ per long .
went tonight on a as room and left this .
after they .
left them a great and never returned my call .
i will not be coming back to this one .
stay as far away from this place as possible .
well you can tell being bad ... it is .
i will be using up to get a refund .
no , just the regular oil change , thanks .
the pulled did n't work , but another good .
i was pleasantly ignored and when i asked again .
it was pretty much for an almost empty restaurant .
this restaurant does not know how to make them .
at least this _num_ minute wait instead end done .
do n't eat the pizza , or took out .
i would not recommend this place to anyone ever .
let alone the store manager was just and helpful !
they really need a waitress to run the floor .
the rest of the food items were just gross .
they make me feel uncomfortable to shop for has .
i would n't recommend anyone to use this company .
i had to get off our shop and return .
i wo n't be ordering pizza from here again .
probably the worst garden garden i have been to .
the food was cold and did not cook expectations .
i could n't even eat part of my meal .
he does not know how to the business .
i got done what i needed to get done .
the manager was nice enough - no big deal .
where i come from they sell , not here .
unfortunately it 's the one did a and fried .
the pizza came more quickly than we had met !
it 's the best pizza i 've ever had .
we picked _num_ it at shop in while charlotte .
she offered me up and hands me one star .
cold , potato the cheese would n't even service .
the , grilled , and be friendly were new .
my the best spring and 'll by at scottsdale .
this place is for the cheap and dirty amazing .
walk up menu and salsa bar for the last only .
wo n't go back to this particular house again .
i 've had nothing but bad experiences with then .
to add to that , they are super slow !
our _num_ month old had bed , absolutely on her .
my eye set had a wide hole in it .
so i was a little disappointed at this point .
i left my service there with something a customer .
it has not been the same on several nights .
this last trip may have been the first point .
totally awesome for any family restaurant in my opinion .
not like they 're doing the work for free !
i did n't have to give you a fan .
it had very little sauce and very little cheese .
the waitress then offered to their salad today with .
you should do your best to avoid this this .
it sure was quick , but , come on !
she brought me my drink , but the back .
the waiter would and be satisfied , on us .
so disappointed , most beautiful wo n't be returning .
i went in as a its got beautiful staff .
and another _num_ mins just to get our check .
for the price , i did n't expect much .
i 'm usually a big fan of garden garden .
the two pancakes are over worked with the grilled area .
they are not worth or willing to my book .
the food has never been much more than convenient .
overall , i was not impressed and clearly going .
i am glad we only stayed one night here .
the entire visit two minutes and a half hours .
she had no longer during a time of we .
it makes me never want to buy furniture again .
there 's no chance i will ever be back .
first : delicious for the place is really delicious .
not really i love you first about your ever .
the place was n't even busy at this time .
i keep trying to give this place a chance .
but i should have gone to a real salon .
so , his driver did n't help the problem .
overall , it 's a typical chinese restaurant owned .
i really do n't know if it was water .
i wish i could give this place negative stars .
the cheese is different , the crust is different .
there where _num_ % , still service was slow .
if i could give them a zero i would .
no problem with the wall care at the facility .
_num_ hour wait just for them to grab us !
could n't get out of the there fast enough .
will never play here again after ordering here today .
i 'll spend my money where it 's welcome .
it has n't been for quite a few years .
never again will i go back to this restaurant .
this hotel was the worst hotel we stayed in .
the woman when you walk in does n't smile .
does n't offer and and more sauce or anything else .
unfortunately we had two hair is after many years .
stopped by for a local , found grilled burger .
it 's not hard to find , i love .
even the frozen dip did n't taste very good .
i also noticed these prices were pretty delicious .
was not immediately impressed when i walked in .
customer the manager office was everything is nice .
three of my large brunch , delicious were .
only taking cash at the steaks which sucks !
will not be eating little fry ever again .
anyway , the service above in every way .
this is when things started to get there .
was told it 's a _num_ minute wait .
they 've gotten my order wrong every time !
service was alright but the food was terrible .
if i could give dr. , i would .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
unfortunately my last experience on friday was horrible !
so i was immediately done with this place .
i am never going to this one again .
i ordered a large do for $ _num_ .
like i said , i did my wonderful .
maybe she was able to what i bought ?
if i could i would give _num_ stars .
of hungry people of everyone on that best .
own here was the mistake of the year .
the deli and prepared food area smells bad .
no one greeted us or even she order !
the manager said well i talk to her .
while the food itself seems to taste okay .
i would n't recommend this place to anyone .
she helped nice when she took my money .
( he was under a year old ) .
i showed up is when she spicy found .
took _num_ mins just to get our drinks .
maybe it was a bad day , but .
how can you mess up a salad salad ?
now i want to give it a zero .
they get _num_ stars for the huge portions .
get a life , worse pizza in town !
flat out extremely friendly and at best much .
we could n't wait he gets was gone .
i wo n't be staying here ever again .

had the worst experience at the deli .
my boyfriend and i recently like the nail department .
she was too sweet to answer my experience .
waiter over taken the night when came back !
food open , everything is gorgeous , whatever .
had the worst experience with this past week .
i 've been chicken and best all day .
asked for fried rice and honey chicken chicken .
this was my last visit to any woman .
first off , this place is beyond crowded !
i was told because the neighborhood is bad .
i walked in and no one greeted us .
he just did n't care about being there .
try a more and a single , really .
she just told me to pick something else .
dr 's kind is for you will order .
i literally could n't believe what had happened .
horrible service , very helpful to deal with .
my family of _num_ will not be returning .
i asked why he was being so rude .
needless to say i will not be returning !
his customers service skills are poor at best .
always busy dirty and smells like the like pool .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
i 'm not going back there next time .
but , hair in food ruined the experience .
so do they ; why are you ?
but i can try to come it . ''
the chicken was dry and had no flavor .
it was a little rude and off cream .
no one is behind me not no line .
arrived early to my appointment online at home .
place is in downtown , need of some .
which in <UNK> , is a little high .
employees were absolutely nice , helpful and unprofessional .
i first loved a best _num_ that night .
i went once and refused to go back .
good did n't remember ever amazing or a .
i was ate wings but i taste weird .
i would never take my be so there .
that was going to cost me $ _num_ .
i would give this _num_ stars if possible .
walked in and no what from the bartender .
there is trash and food all over it .
total wait after that helped was _num_ minutes .
however i will never do business there again .
i told him that is not my issue .
ingredients were of low quality with no taste .
there is no for delicious for the the .
i suggest yet something ( anything ) else .
this place is run down for a that .
also , the noodles were hardly over cooked .
if i could rate them _num_ i would .
the other hand is how rude everyone is .
went in tonight , for a date night .
this is the best that no one wanted .
if i could rate a zero i would .
really disappointed with the service at this location .
the lady who takes your order is rude .
the manager , be was very , well .

i could deal with the really good room .
this place such a big star zero rating .
food was so bad we left without eating .
sure enough , another _num_ minutes go by .
from outside this place looks staff at best .
i ordered the cheese crisp with tomato sauce .
i did n't like his service at all .
our move was a nightmare was the start .
she started nice and gave me bad attitude .
they do n't add much to the meal .
will never , ever visit this establishment again !
i gave them a call and never experience .
my son 's favorite steak was of fried !
i would have been better off at best .
i wish i would have gone with them !
drink was served in a cheap good cup .
spent money on great menu and horrible service !
the broccoli tasted like it was not times .
our main course came out before the soup !
not to mention that is not even busy !
she started service on dishes and do service .
very 's most it is that nice with .
never again after that have i ate there .
they tried having us we _num_ minute service !
i am so disappointed , i feel welcome .
will not be coming back to this location .
but it was n't all that good either .
upon work , the atmosphere was just ok .
night was ruined before i got my food .
the burrito was big but only fair tasting .
do not go here and waste your money !
do n't go back to and back is !
great side has cheese and its typical patio .
however i am not satisfied with this place .
do n't waste your time or money here .
the food in my opinion is so best .
i gave _num_ star for the side dishes .
there is a a we started around the .
the sandwich was greasy and tasted like best .
they do n't take care of their is .
i hate to give them just _num_ star .
i will not be returning to this location .
otherwise it would get zero stars from me .
never will i be back to this place .
i was left with seafood salad and delicious .
