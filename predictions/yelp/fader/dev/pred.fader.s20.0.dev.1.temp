if the whole experience is also by far i had _num_ .
we could n't return , the right amount of small town .
the place was with some nice tables and everything else were a good selection .
not only is the service , the prices were great .
for me being hard with cheese as well , office .
you can keep your own chips and salsa , beef .
the pizza and the wings were all good too much .
but they wo n't be getting any business from them .
first , the manager who helped you were to be friendly .
this is a true family owned and it also were very small .
so of course i am going to use the visit .
the atmosphere that is a bit high location for is .
at least a week and the service is always incredibly clean !
if i could give this place no stars , i would .
at that point i had with a great meal and food .

there was a lot of staff and they were amazing .
i have to enjoy it , in the best mexican food .
i ordered the chicken and it was a little bland .
great taste in the most of what i have had them .
the service was fun and the price has some good too .

great pizza for all my husband made us excellent and flavorful .
my steak was so delicious but worth it is more than everything .
no one came around for all great food and them .
they had excellent job on the front desk to our needs .
i do n't understand why they do n't look amazing .
the place was nice , both ( top notch ) ) .

the cheese was amazing , but the room were clean .
so i asked for the check and the special is the best .
if i had a lot of free , which is great .
i used to love coming and i 've never had ordered all .
that should have been two stars ago and also good spot .
small selection and great prices too long to come back !
been here for years but they can always do the wrong .
i will definitely return and a lot was amazing too .
to say he loves her with their tacos are very sweet .
the fish was nice and the food and cheese and fries .
i thought they were very well , but worth your money !
they also came on my meal and it came out super yummy .
$ _num_ and his staff is just all this place is .
when the food arrived , it was great because of course .
but now there 's a great deal here when we go .
the fried rice was wonderful , even more , and reasonably priced .
we were so disappointed the chicken fried rice is so great .
out of the office staff for years , some of our meals .
he was extremely friendly and efficient , me and he is up !
last _num_ i went to _num_ stars and the shrimp was fun .
which i 'm in a great staff of are fun .
we love coming and they are a friendly little store !
the staff ... you in the neighborhood from a the house .
( here ) did n't think you love : ) .
the restaurant was great for all after and it then !
so very quick and the staff we always very steak and everything .
this is not worth the family to get made happy to find !
the room was well kept up as fast and also cooked .
the atmosphere is fast and it has the taste done .
the wait was huge , friendly , for everything .
the place looks old , and not clean at all .
great neighborhood came out fast and way very well worth .
one star ... it was something to be good .
so they and gave me some small cheese last year ! )
do not get into the meat of my own fries and that .
i would recommend this company at their `` new '' is anything .

they were friendly and extremely helpful , kind with some fantastic .
we did n't see her after making our food today .
