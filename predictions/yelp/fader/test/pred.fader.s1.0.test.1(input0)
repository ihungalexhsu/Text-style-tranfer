i guess anyone eat customer service i made good in old .
the evening started out slow .
let me tell you , this place was far from busy !
i dont know why i was pleasantly anything different .
i guess she was n't happy that we were a regular but .
at this location the service was terrible .
very disappointed and would stay given of this place .
if i could give zero stars i love would .
's feel 's has right to be cheap with their drink for years !
what about the time i wasted ?
she did offer me a reservation if i would like a month out while .
it 's just too expensive for what you get .
there are better happy hours and better beers all around amazing !
she does n't say anything and just right away .
also , the food that is there is n't even great by our local .
the woman did n't even delicious .
they forgot to tell us eating in the bar was an option .
the food was low quality and together specials and wonderful with little flavor .
two hours of my life i can never get back .
management no longer hand about the process experience .
just went back to get the young tire of park and favorite .
she just bought a couple empty dishes and walked off .
as for the food , never had it .
service was just as disappointing .
the food was fantastic and very over priced for what you get .
but the customer service even the best that for me .
needless to say , i saw the store manager after who ate .
no massage with my manicure or pedicure .
i had to leave a his , and they never called me back .
you wo n't find a better selection in scottsdale .
needless to say i will not be back for mexican food .
overall it was a girl evening .
the charge did n't we eggs and a small salad .
crab cakes , salt , no other flavor .
is that a good thing or a bad thing ?
seriously though , i have never heard here .
the best review in scottsdale and the each if a flavorful care of downtown .
the bathroom area is nothing special .
even if i was inside , had , i could n't care this pizza .
maybe they were having a bad night ?
like it 's been in a timely for a week .
the food is not that authentic .
do n't go here unless you want to pay for crap .
i did n't even eat it .
you are not the only place in town with decent pizza .
my boyfriend is only for the two they .
in the long run , they did absolutely nothing for me .
had to wait a month to get in .
then he seemed to tell me how to fix it .
this is the reason i will never go back .
always takes way too long even if you 're the only one there .
i may just pizza so much and love their work .
however , the ladies said nothing to me about this .
i should have yummy with great chinese dining .
yes , the portions were large , but size is n't everything .
i have to say i was truly disappointed .
his egg sandwiches are like shopping are and great .
visit the manager is a horrible person .
the only thing we received that was hot was the coffee .
just left and took it off the bill .
the rooms are not that nice and the food is not that good either .
they tried real hard to get me to come here but i used .
thanks , there is no sausage or bacon on the menu .
no stars is what in want to give .
i looked around and there were still customers .
we will not be coming back .
it did n't matter of she is good at all other times .
went into this location to special off it .
the food is n't too bad but the service is terrible .
so , it went in the trash .
next dish was you chocolate always thanks when they was the owner is very .
anyway , we got our coffee and will not return to this location .
needless to say , i will not be returning to this place ever again .
they do not deliver some of the most recent experience .
if your patio is walking care , you 're out of delicious .
there chips are ok , but their salsa is really bland .
when i arrived , no one was at the desk .
so i brought my business elsewhere .
the birthday surprise has been ruined as well as her special day .
i 'm on a great experience , i 'll come .
the like the rolls is an issue either .
absolutely ridiculous stay away from this place .
anything they say , ask in class .
good little service worth it ?
in addition in my kitchen and bathroom along with friendly can look and no building .
and the food is simply not as good as the other locations .
his offer of a `` free dessert '' was even more knowledgeable .
the beer sauce is impeccable at best .
this is the worst she young location there is !
worst customer service i have ever had .
my husband had to walk up to the bar to place our wine order .
the rest of their food is crispy and their employees and service are horrible .
but their here was know !
not even real tuna sauce .
no , not the very good ... , the very favorite in high .
just a frozen cooked cooked like a home one .
many beef dressing was n't the best by any means .
i will never trust another process or had .
we 've sent enough there who have there who amazing server all for a people .
it does not take that long to cook her !
he did n't even offer another time for me to come in .
dr pieces and clearly other -- i paid for that .
had to see an first bite with best .
it was my last weekend visiting my folks .
we both found it overcooked -- and no the .
there was only meat and bread .
the only positive was able to eat was the really beef beef !
were we another staff or something ?
the food was pretty bad , i would not go there again .
this place is just ok .
i 've never had a worse experience than this !
i do not recommend anyone to this starbucks .
if i was the manager , i 'd appreciate that one on the spot .
the problem is nothing was good .
overall : lost my business and family for a good local place .
however , this experience went pretty inexpensive .
you can not recommend best people on my house .
it is not really like rice .
said we could visit with my friend at all they only the spot before .
not so much these days .
the place is small , i 'm sure she could have it comes out .
not sure or warm at all .
service fair , he was bad only guy - long server .
the sandwich was not that great .
the food was mediocre at best , but even portions and not cooked well .
i have not received such an attitude because a customer before .
i went to sit down and wait for my order .
this place is a terrible place to live !
just terrible is all i can say .
we will spend our money elsewhere .
we sit down and we got some really slow and reliable service .
i love the food ... however service here is horrible .
but this place was not even and the a different meat .
when it came we should have sent it back .
so , that was my one and only time ordering the there .
no , their and food is excellent .
if i had wanted it away i would have gotten it myself !
the .
new owner , i can but when i know do n't the waitress .
these days the quality is pretty delicious .
one was my for dog , and one was for my wife 's dog .
prime rib was crisp and not cooked fresh check .
the wine was very average and the food was even less .
think twice -- this place is a of .
the to crab great garlic and stay on our door his he go up .
too bad it was at the register of the other customers .
so , no , so thorough to help me deal to any of our purchase .
`` no , we are going to have a my sweet because .
i was so glad i could not wait for the rest of the day .
found the place even though it is hard to most great on .
sadly , i will probably never be able to eat at this place again .
the service is mediocre and the restaurant is just average .
and for this reason , i wo n't return .
i will never visit the salon again .
parking : no wonder or anything , so you just have to guess .
i guess even great restaurants have bad days .
i refused to purchase any of the it hand on quality .
but it was disgusting and hot in there .
so i ordered my daughter online , an appointment for an two days out .
did n't feel like staying with the restaurants to this too .
this is the worst neighborhood sub market out of any of them .
i did n't know their meal there can get from customer .
we went there on a busy weekend weekend and the service was extremely slow .
also , could not and another such a crab of coffee cheese or red ?
i 'm no let them know but they apparently dont care .
we did n't leave with anything that day .
we gave it another week minutes before we got up and left .
this pretty i took worse and worse .
unfortunately , the by coffee are not impressive .
zero star with his work .
it looks like an egg and car gave into the 'm cheese pieces .
do not sign a ton with these people .
this was by far the nice person i said with .
this place is beyond a very different .
i said it was disgusting to even serve this to my .
i expected so much better from this starbucks excellent .
only time enjoy ever on , i was the only one in the pool .
this one is not on the weekends .
took my way to get .
it tasted like big will and had the same tough roll .
this place has her plus off for the last time .
i 'm still giving my noodles noodles !
it 's not my favorite , but it 's not awful .
tasted really old , i could n't believe it .
i bought eating and we went back to the beer .
but it may not actually be in az anyway .
we then our order our with our extremely rude and absolutely completely girl server .
i do not like the size of the floor floor .
good he would walk by it 's definitely under in pittsburgh .
when it finally came out , it was bad .
overcooked so much that it was the because of the pork spring fish .
the .
i tried to call !
this spot was my favorite indian restaurant .
stopped by for walking after being at the bar anyone next door .
great , i do n't take any bed bed with me .
this piece of finally gave me delicious if in the room .
oh well , who knows ... right ?
went to the sunday brunch to their us 's always making all .
it did n't get finished .
the food 's ok , the service is delicious of the best i have .
.
service was average but could not make up for the poor food and drink .
but was very disappointed with what actually arrived .
i was also about another regular during which but he turned up with another .
horrible job on nails and and make .
since we fun , the only server we are best really accommodating !
always rude in their time and always have great customer service !
my mom ordered the chicken teriyaki combo and called and the ordered _num_ pieces .
she said `` will be back and their more for a few .
my plate looked pricey half empty .
the white sauce was too sweet too .
in addition my mouth are from burnt the noodles and all the flavor and all .
the sales people here are terrible .
the calamari of the meat just looked and tasted wrong .
but it probably sucks too !
no , i 'm not at a club club .
they wo n't tell you though .
it 's always busy and the restaurant is very dirty .
absolutely terrible , do not order from this place .
it 's not much like an amazing like which , which is great .
my pad thai tasted like thai rice noodles with no spicy .
, best and some people is impressed than other places .
the salads are ok , nothing special .
did they not have a ton from our bread ?
this is a horrible venue .
now it is not so thin and taste like any other pizza place .
they can thank you for the low rating .
i wish i could give less than one star .
the beer was nice and cold !
he could n't actually read her questions , though .
i would never recommend anyone to live here .
french french toast was good , mom said , and really sandwiches bread .
i called at best and got the complete enjoy off .
my girlfriend found a dead pie under one of the seats .
i know i should have sent this back and walk out .
great , see , spectacular on tap .
avoid if at all possible .
you can not pay me to ever shop here !
there are no selection and no customer service .
they charged me for work not done , and not office great .
this is a terrible she .
we 'll see if that is happy , but i 'm definitely my favorite .
she said `` yes , sorry . ''
ever since has changed hands changed it 's just low and worse drinks .
bad service in these and cash were absolutely the visit .
they also have lost my personal of this mexican food is good .
this is a far from real from new best mexican .
other than that , i really do n't know what was good about it .
and the pizza was cold , greasy , and quite also awful .
salsa is not hot or good .
owner : a very rude man .
stay away , and go to her bar .
i would n't go back there again .
we 've been to this long he have many hours .
<UNK> 's huge on every single .
i 'm from the local time and this was a disappointment and over priced .
the staff was on will be back .
however , everyone else paid after their nails were great .
not so great food and service .
so disappointing from an old favorite .
desert loves but nothing special .
be friendly , $ _num_ really , n't need just yet .
perfect , way way worse .
we 'll in there for us and only we remember this .
i asked for thai hot and received very little delicious .
my first for not looking more flavorful , i guess .
you 'll have zero after packed the first bite .
i mean that 's been my experience !
an old friend did my pedicure .
sushi , best , you are so to me .
the building itself looks fantastic .
i had a horrible experience , and i recommend not sure to come .
i do not like to be staying over , or nice unique .
the food here is bland and boring and bad .
dr. of honey pizza delivery !
the fried rice was gross and there was a grilled of it .
the store is looking for full and help to change .
no wonder these restaurants are up all up around the valley .
i just walked out , called the manager to complain .
they really need to work on their customer service and truly good .
so you are n't my problem . ''
i wanted to like this place but it just a big disappointment one .
there is definitely not enough room in that part of the venue .
plus the woman did n't even know how to work the as .
she was not happy being there .
my wife came in for him is and really quite great .
first , the bartender was an a unique as .
i ca n't believe how awesome this mall is .
unfortunately , it is the worst .
only then did our waitress show up with another couple full of water full .
oh , i should not have asked .
i was very sick on our night .
what the hell are you doing ?
however , the manager came back & told me my order was coming up .
it is also quite expensive for my taste .
for the not that the great good pedicure i , use it !
it is way overpriced ( as me they go they !
one of the employees says , but it did n't seem very welcome .
i left hungry and think that not again .
the burgers were over cooked to the point the meat was chewy .
great food but horrible staff and very very rude workers !
they deliver , staff to do for someone to understand their customers .
three guys is inexpensive lunch and last friday at <UNK> the airport .
this is easily the best thai food i 've had in my life .
bottom line they over checking and under excellent .
i 've eaten here many times , but none as bad as last night .
the a thing a mess .
so i asked for the card to be desired .
other than that , food here is pretty gross .
they tried to take the more of me i am nice .
the green potatoes were ok but not great .
the beans were in the box in the rice was mostly to be found .
their cheese i 'm greeted was of the good variety .
the place has still are going over the years .
nothing that special about this place .
i also told him i would leave him some good customer online .
when i was finally there , i was very disappointed .
she did not we or anything .
prices are just plain .
it smelled and tasted like best 's oil .
not sure and i do n't care !
it was so much not good that i just wanted out of there .
this was my first stop in looking for a wedding wedding .
we asked how long the wait would be , she said she was amazing .
i 'm not a fan of huge chain restaurants .
if i was n't with my by , i would 've walked out .
the food is worse than you find in the wall with at it .
i may make it back to the bar but i will be the restaurant .
awesome sauce had way too much their at it .
this location is super busy and really could use the staff .
great bread should be offered at no charge .
she could not and would not i finally recommend .
its also not a very clean park .
it is n't terrible , but it is n't very good either .
the others ordered the short after pretty i also , pork and dry .
the see are very thorough as usual .
i was very disappointed with this place .
food was fairly maybe we should have ordered off the mexican menu .
lost a long time customer !
in this price was a they think a <UNK> place and an after wedding .
it was so happy , i asked her if she was great !
this woman should not be in the service ; in phoenix to bad of all .
we told them to grab it , we did n't want to wait .
chicken fried chicken was dry but the green chili cheese and was good cheese .
the get honey waitress was a huge fan .
it was great from breakfast but , though i do n't think he knows .
they only received one star because you have to cook a rating .
this was the first time i ever recommend them in a haircut .
too bad too because they sell an outstanding beer .
either way i would never recommend buying from them desert .
do not go to this practice they are horrible !
they make a bad name for used car far .
i 'm not one of the wall people .
will never go back to every guy they always from plus the time !
what a waste of my time and their .
i expected service to be slow that morning , and it was .
who knows , it might have been .
i hate to see what their delivery times and how here it 's perfect .
finally , the cheese crisp was crisp and was reasonable and crispy .
even the ice cream was very , very run of the of city .
just do n't bother ordering anything if you 're seated .
food was cold ( still frozen ) , i had the ribs .
this place is a hole hole with always service .
we will not be using this location again .
i 'll keep looking for a different salon .
the bread was soggy and the dip was amazing .
so fried tasted watered down .
this is an old out one ... .
my neighborhood restaurant about food .
it 's sitting on a saturday night there was n't a long wait .
there was no i 'm sorry or how did everything come out .
as an arizona surprise , i have been going to the <UNK> for years .
his neighborhood by that definitely that do n't understand customer service .
the only thing i was offered was a free dessert .
the mashed potatoes was very thorough and had weird burrito .
had one pizza disappointing and said , `` we 'll try again '' .
the man did not stop her .
my services were very rushed and she did n't even do a good job .
it looks old and pork .
the rice was cold and hard and the taste was very bland .
horrible , horrible , horrible service !
so who do i call to get my money back .
it was over fried and very hard .
i think it 's terrible when employees care that way .
i 'm not willing to take the chance .
i wish i and sure he went back to take care of the bill .
the woman who works in the deli is horrible .
sad what has happened to this sandwich shop .
was n't busy , no sense .
i wo n't be ordering again .
the new management team is horrible !
when i first came to today ... yes this particular place to me .
second time , not so good .
what were you going to charge me when i purchase a good green ?
the lady at the front desk was not very friendly .
the 's looked like chicken looked chinese and were fresh with our own .
the garlic bread was bland and cold .
many minutes i came do you be going to other locations from now on .
did n't seem to care about their job .
when she did n't finish him quickly enough , he felt the up each .
the <UNK> bed was horrible !
there is a reason they can get you in fairly quickly .
the , it was incredible great .
do not go here if you are in eating good food in .
no call , no nothing .
my `` hot '' sub was cold and the meat was crispy .
is zero stars an option ?
i got there , was seated pretty quickly , and then ruined my color .
simply , there are far other places to go for sushi .
overall , i do n't enjoy the place very much .
<UNK> itself however is not so amazing .
let me give my opinion , that 's what this is for what .
if i could give less stars , i would .
very crowded , pricey have to a chance to actually have a good time .
it is the absolute worse place in the valley .
when i picked up the order , i was given another her more disappointment .
i checked online , and the salmon he saw me as good was .
we 've tried the ribs pancakes as well .
save your money & your own .
the beer is n't bad , but the food was less than best .
great side : no more amazing services locations .
had it not been so best selection the just they be really had any .
definitely disappointed that i could not use my birthday birthday !
i will not pizza this course as a fresh with time to play here .
it 's that this restaurant has no class .
in overall who our favorite my business to , & fresh & easy .
this is the third time they 've been that under that .
however , it turned out to be nothing like i thought it would .
there are much better places for breakfast .
and management does n't do anything about it .
he did not return my call either .
the thai pasta was perfect came out spicy and .
and the cleaning is way over priced .
i ordered garlic bread and for chocolate pasta with vegetables .
the beef taco was good but nothing special .
only now i 'm really hungry , and really off customer .
even the water tasted horrible .
that person who get their meal until everyone else was delicious with breakfast .
the busy always is no longer an option .
talk about best n't so call before you go !
my and favorite and one was these .
as soon as they delivered i was like treated .
she was getting everything , and so were we .
all she did a total me of the kids and around that the pork '' .
so sad but i am not going back any more .
so far i 'm not really impressed .
thank i 'm waiting for an appointment .
but i bought sure could have cooked this one .
tonight i lost all great for this company .
if you atmosphere a lot do not stay at this hotel .
incredible , low price specials and the that pool .
so one person would eat while everyone else was nice and delivery for another .
when the manager finally showed up he was rude and and !
the air air air in the middle is very loud .
actually , just keep walking .
i ordered a wide salad with a side of chicken amazing .
service was a little slow to but with .
i was n't going to let her do a thing done to me .
she recommend to anyone a find for two shop those just people .
i would rather wait for hot food than it have cold and soggy .
but unfortunately the rude woman was the one checking us out .
they 're near your definitely any that takes out .
the decor was seriously lacking .
this place is dirty and run down and the service here !
i did n't know everyone was a chain .
the only great it was the black beans .
did n't even get a response .
my dish was pretty salty and could barely taste the garlic crab .
the server was n't really .
the pizza is offered without toppings and it 's lacking in flavor .
do n't waste the trip .
i was not impressed , and would not recommend this place .
this room that he found also liked my 's !
i just received a delivery order from them and was new girl my .
the office also very than happy it at this top whole experience .
i , `` and stars ... no i 'm cool .
management does not seem to care .
when i return in a care review , i came and down my orders .
would have become call if i could .
the game is a room for my bar , well and money .
but sure not but a chinese their desert was ... truly .
one bite surprised after another they do n't care to be .
so he can charge a in just for them .
the overall prices are not that wonderful and .
half of my favorite was over priced .
there was no excuse to our server .
i tried to no response .
now the food : not horrible , but below average .
went back in for vegas , but still love .
moved off my red lobster and three of beautiful hand of .
but let this place fan at chicken today .
i '' love about delicious style their really amazing are really .
the door would n't open at all .
been past the orange , they were dry and truly tasteless .
ate best n't <UNK> , now not so much .
i just left this car wash and was very there !
this place has more neighborhood old for some reason .
i 'm sure he must get it right some things , but this one .
looking ... we just told him that we did n't want to this server .
