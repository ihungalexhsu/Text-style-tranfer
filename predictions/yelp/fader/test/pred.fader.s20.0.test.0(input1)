this place is try your food and dry .
the fish tacos was very bland .
if you 're looking and this is out of town for the cheap .
he was both professional and courteous .
an hour later for our server .
decent selection of people and fish .
stopped in for lunch , ca n't believe they were really bad .
_num_ of each were to get away .
its not cheap but the portions of food is good .
it is an old mess .
they were horrible , like , authentic mexican place at beef .
good selection of fish and quality and chicken .
the lunch and dinner were as good as well .
always a fun and friendly atmosphere .
try something the drive thru and you will have n't be returning !
