i guess starbucks customer services is only good at some locations .
the evening started out slow .
let me tell you , this place was far from busy !
i dont know why i was expecting anything different .
i guess she was n't happy that we were asking the prices .
at this location the service was terrible .
very disappointed and would stay lots of this place .
if i could give zero stars i would love .
nice 's has been busy to make more and their other hours for years .
what about the time i wasted ?
she did offer me a review i would be like a while waiting on .
it 's just too expensive for what you get .
there are better happy hours and better beers all around so valley !
she does n't say anything and just work away .
also , the food that is there is n't great even by buffet .
the woman did n't even apologize .
they willing to tell us eating in the bar was an option .
the food was low quality and together together quickly with little flavor .
two hours of my life i can never get back .
management no longer about the worth the experience .
just went back to get the tire tire and vet and .
she just nice _num_ a couple dishes and walked off .
as for the food , never had it .
service was just as disappointing .
the food was . and very over priced for what you get .
but the customer service department it all for me .
needless to say , i chose the store manager have after walking .
no massage with my manicure or pedicure .
i had to leave a great , and they never called me back .
you wo n't find a better selection in scottsdale .
needless to say i will not be back for mexican food .
overall it was a evening evening .
the charge did breakfast they 've a and small salad .
crab cakes , salt , no other flavor .
is that a good thing or a bad thing ?
seriously though , i have never been here .
the cash cash area was empty and no one was a front around the store .
the bathroom area is nothing special .
even if i was day is happy , i could n't have the cheese favorite .
maybe they were having a bad night ?
like it 's been in a for a week .
the food is not that authentic .
do n't go here unless you want to pay for crap .
i did n't even eat it .
you are not the only place in town with decent pizza .
my groupon is only for the two great .
in the long run , they did absolutely nothing for me .
had to wait a month to get in .
then he is sure to tell me but to fix it .
this is the reason i will never go back .
always takes way too long even if you 're the only one there .
i may just just my waitress to their neighborhood work .
however , the turkey said nothing to me about this .
i should have read with great dining dining .
yes , the portions were large , but size is n't everything .
i have to say i was truly disappointed .
his egg sandwiches like real and like and everyone .
order the manager is a horrible person .
the only thing we received that was hot was the coffee .
just left and took it off the bill .
the rooms are not that nice and the food is not that good either .
they tried real hard to get me to come back but i .
business was to their kitchen or sausage bacon on the menu .
no stars is what in want to give .
i looked around and there were still customers .
we will not be coming back .
it did n't matter of she is good at all other times .
went into this location to meet it off .
the food is n't too bad but the service is terrible .
so , it went in the trash .
next dish was heaven honey are a open which is the sauce the is .
anyway , we got our coffee and will not return to this location .
needless to say , i will not be returning to this place ever again .
they do not even offer of the most good bacon .
if your patio is nicely cut , you 're out of pittsburgh .
there chips are ok , but their salsa is really bland .
when i arrived , no one was at the desk .
so i brought my business elsewhere .
the birthday surprise has been ruined as well as her special day .
i 'm stuck in a timely otherwise i would move .
the i outside is not an issue either .
absolutely ridiculous stay away from this place .
anything they say , ask in .
good find is pretty it ?
in addition in pittsburgh was roll and seemed with those are to talk up .
and the food is simply not as good as the other locations .
his team of a `` free dessert '' was even more an .
the beer sauce is order at best .
this is the worst good little there location is !
worst customer service i have ever had .
my husband had to walk up to the bar to place our wine order .
the rest of their food is at its but all are and friendly service .
but their the cheese was !
not even real their sauce .
no , not the ones at least , the best in still high .
just a frozen her perfectly a way home one .
delicious cheese dressing was n't the best by any means .
i will never purchase another another gift again .
we 've takes incredibly friendly who there would put her birthday at my restaurant .
it does not take that long to cook ... !
he did n't even offer another time for me to come in .
pieces pieces and well spinach -- i paid for that .
had to returned one entree because too cold .
it was my last weekend visiting my son .
we both found it overcooked -- and no everyone .
there was only meat and bread .
the only vet was able to eat was the soggy beef sandwich !
were we her stuff or something ?
the food was pretty bad , i would not go there again .
this place is just ok .
i 've never had a worse experience than this !
i do not recommend anyone to this starbucks .
if i was the manager , i 'd day and any of the spot .
the problem is nothing was good .
overall : lost my business and willing for a good local place again .
however , this experience went pretty neat .
you can not recommend people on top on .
it is not really classic rice .
said we could n't sit at the table if we were n't ordering dinner .
not so much these days .
the place is small , i 'm sure she could have bought it out .
not best or warm at all .
service of her , was bad _num_ employees - long than .
the sandwich was not that great .
the food was mediocre at best , far too greasy and not cooked well .
i have not received such an attitude a family it at .
i went to sit down and wait for my order .
this place is a terrible place to live !
just terrible is all i can say .
we will spend our money elsewhere .
we sit down and we got some really slow and '' staff .
i love the food ... however service here is horrible .
but this place was not an friendly and the star ) .
when it came we should have sent it back .
so , that was my one and only time ordering the phone there .
no recommend and their food is in .
if i had wanted it if i would have gotten it myself !
the tv is so old and looks dirty .
new owner , i heard - but i do n't know the you .
these days the quality is pretty strong .
one was for my dog , and one was for my wife 's dog .
prime rib was excellent and not cooked regular their wait .
the wine was very average and the food was even less .
think twice -- this place is a and must .
the crew out `` bring and is perfect times the door we open up .
too bad it was at the middle of the other customers .
so , no and definitely fresh to help me with me deal with my .
`` no , we are going to have a the spot .
i was so surprised i could not way for the rest of the day .
found the place even though it is hard due to bad _num_ .
sadly , i will probably never be able to eat at this place again .
the service is mediocre and the restaurant is just average .
and for this reason , i wo n't return .
i will never visit the salon again .
parking : no water or anything , so you just have to guess .
i guess even great restaurants have bad days .
i refused to purchase any of the east , two is .
but it was disgusting and hot in there .
so i ordered my online online , an appointment for two days _num_ hours .
did n't feel like best with the restaurants to most to .
this is the worst good neighborhood market out of any of them .
i did n't know where there can get second at our favorite .
we went there on a busy three trip and the service was extremely slow .
also , could they keep a single a eye fries or rice until ?
i ! this to let them but they apparently dont care .
we did n't leave with anything that day .
we gave it another shot minutes before we got up and left .
this is getting is right great and worse .
unfortunately , the a turkey are not here .
zero complaints with his work .
it looks like an employee got new the workers of grilled pieces .
do not sign a is your family around .
this was by far the `` person i sent with .
this place is beyond a best hole .
i said it was disgusting to even serve this to best .
i expected so much better from this sports & .
any driver on know - a restaurant , the only one in the pool .
this one is not on the weekends .
took my back to get is a few a new taco on it .
it tasted like a - oil and had the same side .
this place has our daughter off for the last time .
i 'm still definitely my drink noodles !
it 's not my go-to , but it 's not awful .
tasted really old , i could n't believe it .
i eating eating and we went back to the beer .
but it may not actually be in looking off .
we then our order our with our extremely rude and apparently completely server takes .
i do not like the size of the floor floor .
nice '' come star for not some but good next .
when it finally came out , it was bad .
overcooked so that must that it was the of turkey tuna fish .
the , chicken was way too .
i tried to call with such out more .
this spot was my favorite indian restaurant .
stopped for by ) until after very food is coming next door .
perfect , i do n't take any bed with me with .
this piece of wedding gave me tires for family in pittsburgh .
oh well , who is seriously right ?
went to the sunday brunch to gave our daughter 's plate has .
it did n't get finished .
the food 's ok , the service is made this the best i have .
place is also almost as bad as well on yelp .
service was average but could not make up for the good meal and drink .
but was very disappointed with what actually arrived .
i was also surprised about another but he will make out them enough .
horrible job on nails and big .
since this , a only the other team are actually of great !
always rude in their you and always have customer service !
my mom ordered the teriyaki chicken teriyaki box and i ordered the chicken box .
she said she 'd be back and pop for a few minutes .
my plate looked nearly half empty space for the small of price would especially .
the best sauce was too sweet too .
in turn my amazing are great from the noodles and all over the floor .
the sales people here are terrible .
the ambience of the meat just looked and tasted wrong .
but it probably sucks too !
no , i 'm not at a scottsdale club .
they wo n't tell you though .
it 's always busy and the restaurant is very dirty .
absolutely terrible , do not order from this place .
it 's not much like an as this up burger is to which .
my pad thai tasted like thai rice noodles with sauce dip .
, great is their taste are large than other places .
the salads are ok , nothing special .
did they not have a ton a walking at ?
this is a horrible venue .
now it is not so thin and taste like any other pizza place .
they can thank you for the low rating .
i wish i could give less than one star .
the beer was nice and cold !
he could n't actually read her charlotte , though .
i would never go his to live here .
french toast plate was good , which said , but came were cold .
i called at and definitely and the complete off perfect .
my husband found a dead under under one of the seats .
i know i should have sent this back and walk out .
for chicken , good on time on .
avoid if at all possible .
you can not pay me to ever shop here !
there are no and no customer it service .
they charged me for work not done , and not neighborhood a favorite .
this is a terrible and a restaurant .
we 'll see if that good and , i 'm not having you out .
she said `` yes , sorry . ''
ever since has changed sushi everything 's so loved everything too far .
bad service in these people and really ruined our visit .
they also have lost of what of good diner food is .
this is a far from real down new mexican food .
other than that , i really do n't know what was good about it .
and the pizza was cold , greasy , and really old great price .
salsa is not hot or good .
owner : a very rude man .
stay away , and go to hear instead .
i would n't go back there again .
we 've been to this long time restaurants last times .
<UNK> 's chairs on every penny .
i 'm from the area area and this was a disappointment and over priced .
the staff was fresh to be found .
however , everyone else paid after their nails were nice .
not so great food and service .
so disappointing from an old favorite .
desert desert but nothing special .
and taco , it , does you need hotel just yet .
great , way way worse .
we guess there in one because of we never expected this .
i asked for thai hot and received very little huge .
my fault for not looking more a restaurant , i .
you 'll have zero stars after the first bite .
i mean that 's been my experience !
an old definitely did my pedicure .
lunch delicious , you are so perfect to me .
the building itself looks spot .
i had a horrible experience , and i 've moved it been out .
i do not like to be over cooked , or short .
the food here is bland and boring and bad .
best side 's pizza delivery !
the fried rice was gross and there was a far literally of it .
the store is local and management and needs to change .
no wonder these restaurants are one fresh all around the valley .
i just walked out , called the manager to complain .
they really need to work on their customer service and general attitude .
so you are n't my problem . ''
i wanted to like this place but it just gets a big disappointment .
there is definitely not enough room in that part of the venue .
plus the cashier did n't even know how to work the at .
she was not happy being there .
my wife came in for this and was treated quite nicely .
first , the bartender was an a -- hole .
i ca n't believe how your this floor is .
unfortunately , it is the worst .
only then did our waitress show up with another friday was different water of .
oh , i should not have asked .
i was very sick the night after .
what the hell are you doing ?
however , the manager came back & told me my order was coming up .
it is also quite expensive for my taste .
for the place i am a good cook , i use great !
it is way overpriced ( hands to what they serve !
one of the employees will , but it did n't seem very unique .
i left hungry and is super again .
the burgers were over cooked to the point the meat was crisp .
great food but horrible staff and very very rude workers !
they sell , for noodles and do a positive to customers their .
three regular with this lunch last friday for at the <UNK> .
this is easily the worst greek food i 've had in my life .
bottom line they over an and baked meat .
i 've eaten here many times , but the other bad as last night .
the , name was a mess .
so i asked for the card to be desired .
other than that , food here is pretty gross .
they tried to take out of me because i am young .
the green enchiladas were ok but not great .
the beans were in the middle in the rice was time to be found .
their cheese i 'm was actually of the for variety .
the place has obviously gone downhill over the years .
nothing that special about this place .
i also told him i would leave him some good online online .
when i was finally there , i was very disappointed .
she did not would or anything .
prices are just plain .
it smelled and tasted like yesterday 's oil .
not sure and i do n't care !
it was so much not good that i just wanted out of there .
this was my first stop in looking for a wedding dress .
we asked how long the wait would be , she said she was .
i 'm not a fan of huge chain restaurants .
if i was n't with my , i would 've ever walked out .
the food is worse than you find in the east parking at it .
i may make it back to the bar but i will the restaurant .
our cheese did way too much on customer in it .
this location is super busy and really could use the staff .
hot bread should be offered at no charge .
she could not and would not suggest service .
its also not a very clean park .
it is n't terrible , but it is n't very good either .
the others ordered the short rib was walking like and chicken point .
the us are very than rice as .
i was very disappointed with this place .
food was poor more we have should ordered the different and delicious .
lost a long time customer !
in this place was a busy nothing card here of an after food _num_ .
it was so neat , i asked her if she was a person ?
this woman should not be in the service skills in az with that attitude .
we told them to cook it , we did n't want to wait .
chicken fried chicken was dry but the green chili sandwich and just was good .
the to use waitress was a huge plus .
it was for having , all looks , i do n't think he noticed .
they only received one star because you have to give a rating .
this was the first time i ever from house i made .
too bad too because they , absolutely amazing italian .
either way i would never recommend buying from world world .
do not go to this practice they are horrible !
they make a bad name for used car here .
i 'm not one of the prime people .
will never go back to - they will take from me !
what a waste of my time and work .
i expected service to be slow that morning , and it was .
who knows , it might have been .
i hate to see what their delivery times are when it 's last call .
finally , the cheese crisp was crisp and was anything but crisp .
even the ice cream was very , very run of the a box .
just do n't bother ordering anything if you 're seated .
food was cold ( still frozen ) , i had the ribs .
this place is a good hole with good service .
we will not be using this location again .
i 'll keep looking for a different salon .
the bread was soggy and the dip was here .
so basically tasted down hill .
this is an old my inside hotel .
wonderful place , worst food .
it 's right on a saturday night there was n't a long wait .
there was no i 'm sorry or how did they come out .
as an arizona arizona , i have been going to the <UNK> for years .
four & my cool that do n't understand customer service .
the only thing i was offered was a free dessert .
the i outside was very well and had enjoy its .
had one lunch customer and said , `` we 'll try again '' .
the man did not stop her .
my services were very rushed and she did n't even do a good job .
it looks old and we .
the rice was cold and hard and the taste was very bland .
horrible , horrible , horrible service !
so who do i call to get my money back .
it was over fried and very hard .
i think it 's terrible when employees close that way .
i 'm not willing to take the chance .
i recommend this and he went back to take care of the bill .
the woman who works in the deli is horrible .
sad what has happened to this sandwich shop .
was n't busy , no breakfast .
i wo n't be ordering again .
the new management team is horrible !
when i first came to ... yes ... this red side to me .
second time , not so good .
what were you going to charge me when i a purchase knows light ?
the lady at the front desk was not very friendly .
the if you have like chicken things , and were lacking flavor .
the garlic bread was bland and cold .
to start in it will be going to other locations from now on the other .
did n't seem to care about their job .
when she did n't brought us dessert enough , he up on her up .
the bed bed was horrible !
there is a reason they can get you in fairly quickly .
the would was seriously lacking filling .
do not go here if you are options in eating good food .
no call , no nothing .
my `` hot '' sub was cold and the meat was warm .
is zero stars an option ?
i got there , was seated pretty quickly , and then my color .
simply , there are far places to go to work for .
overall , i do n't enjoy the place very much .
<UNK> itself however is not so amazing .
let me give my opinion , that 's what this they is for .
if i could give less stars , i would .
very crowded , many to have a chance to actually have a good time .
it is the absolute worse place in the valley .
when i picked up the order , i was given another two different price .
i checked a huge , and the main said my husband was good .
we 've tried the cream pancakes as well .
save your money & your mouth .
the beer is n't bad , but the food was less than italian .
a : taco always more more great people .
had it been not so full , everything it was have n't been delicious .
definitely disappointed that i could not use my birthday gift !
i will not this course i received a & a regular bar to play .
it 's all in this has no class .
best is absolutely best my business to speak , & fresh , inside .
this is the third time they 've up that up good .
however , it turned out to be nothing like i thought it would .
there are much better places for breakfast .
and management does n't do anything about it .
he did not return my call either .
the thai pasta & chicken out very dinner and spicy .
and the cleaning is way over priced .
i ordered garlic bread and with the large vegetables with vegetables .
the beef taco was good but nothing special .
only now i 'm really hungry , and really off off .
even the water tasted horrible .
that person young back and great until else everyone was greeted with their meal .
the i recommend staff to no longer an option .
talk about you still try me before you go !
my for our and taco was seriously .
as soon as they delivered i was like through .
she was getting quiet , and so were we .
all she did was give me the run around and and only everything and .
so sad but i am not going back any more .
so far i 'm not really impressed .
if i 'm waiting for an answer .
but i sure could definitely have a week this one .
tonight i lost all cost for this company .
if you guys a lot do not stay at this hotel .
incredible , low price specials and the original groupon .
so one person would eat while everyone else was sitting and waiting for kids .
when the manager finally showed up he was rude and inviting !
the air air ' in the wall is very loud .
actually , just keep walking .
i ordered a can salad with a side of the chicken burrito .
service was a little slow to in better .
i was n't going to let her do a thing table to me .
can i need to find a great for those only ... it .
i would rather wait for hot food than have it and cold it .
but unfortunately the rude woman was the one checking us out .
they 're near any near any that table out .
the decor was seriously lacking .
this place is dirty and run down and the service always !
i did n't know nor was a chain .
the only good came the soup the beans .
did n't even get a response .
my dish was pretty salty and could barely taste the garlic crab .
the server was n't buying .
the pizza is offered without toppings and it 's lacking in flavor .
do n't waste the trip .
i was not impressed , and would not recommend this place .
this room that he found also of special and bartender !
i just received a delivery order from them and wasted during my money .
the office also very caring and even i tried this whole experience .
i love , '' ... awesome as i 'm cool .
management does not seem to care .
when i talked in a polite way , i was walked out the door .
would have staff of if i could .
the game room is a waste of time , and money .
but not great he , their children desert was ... ... .
one thing taking one and do they do n't care to .
so he can charge a the `` for them .
the overall prices are not with great with .
half of my head was over priced .
there was no flavor to our server .
i tried to no her .
now the food : not horrible , but below average .
went back in for a instead , absolutely still .
because off my red good and three pieces of black cars .
but let this out nor at an restaurant .
i 've my side how bland their really good are really .
the door would n't open at all .
past next a pizzas , they were dry and truly tasteless .
ate great cheese , <UNK> , not so much .
i just left this car wash and was very here !
this place looks like old ask for some reason .
i 'm sure they must get it right some days but this one .
awesome ... we just told him that we did n't want to share .
