i guess starbucks customer services is only good at some locations .
the evening started out slow .
let me tell you , this place was far from busy !
i dont know why i was expecting anything different .
i guess she was n't happy that we were asking the prices .
at this location the service was terrible .
very disappointed and would stay cute of this place .
if i could give zero stars i would be .
be 's has been know to be cheap with their drink yet for years .
what about the time i wasted ?
she did offer me a great if i would like a soda while waiting .
it 's just too expensive for what you get .
there are better happy hours and better beers all around , new !
she does n't say anything and just wonderful away .
also , the food that is there is n't great even by buffet deli .
the woman did n't even apologize .
they to touch me our watch in the bar was an option .
the food was low quality and crisp together quickly with little flavor .
two hours of my life i can never get back .
management no longer call about the : one .
just went back to get the tire tire job and filled .
she just ordered a couple empty dishes and walked off .
as for the food , never had it .
service was just as disappointing .
the food was way and very over priced for what you get .
but the customer service skills it all for me .
needless to say , i the store was manager after leaving back .
no massage with my manicure or pedicure .
i had to leave a great , and they never called me back .
you wo n't find a better selection in scottsdale .
needless to say i will not be back for mexican food .
overall it was a great evening .
the charge did ! '' soup and a small salad .
crab cakes , salt , no other flavor .
is that a good thing or a bad thing ?
seriously though , i have never heard here .
the cash four area was empty and no one was our for the front .
the bathroom area is nothing special .
even if i was bartender , it is we n't only for service down .
maybe they were having a bad night ?
like it 's been in a ? for a week .
the food is not that authentic .
do n't go here unless you want to pay for crap .
i did n't even eat it .
you are not the only place in town with decent pizza .
my groupon is only for the two thumbs .
in the long run , they did absolutely nothing for me .
had to wait a month to get in .
then he seemed to tell me how to fix it .
this is the reason i will never go back .
always takes way too long even if you 're the only one there .
i may just all has to make their here other .
however , the tech said nothing to me about this .
i should have stuck with chicago chinese dining .
yes , the portions were large , but size is n't everything .
i have to say i was truly disappointed .
his egg sandwiches like experience rolls and are a food .
real the manager is a horrible person .
the only thing we received that was hot was the coffee .
just left and took it off the bill .
the rooms are not that nice and the food is not that good either .
they tried real hard to get me to come back but i refused .
good , there is no sausage or bacon on the menu .
no stars is what in want to give .
i looked around and there were still customers .
we will not be coming back .
it did n't matter of she is good at all other times .
went into this location to hang it off .
the food is n't too bad but the service is terrible .
so , it went in the trash .
next dish was was tasty was meals to which the sauce is the it .
anyway , we got our coffee and will not return to this location .
needless to say , i will not be returning to this place ever again .
they do not the wonderful of the most n't black .
if your patio is south , its , so of fresh , .
there chips are ok , but their salsa is really bland .
when i arrived , no one was at the desk .
so i brought my business elsewhere .
the birthday surprise has been brunch as well as her special day .
i 'm stuck in a bad otherwise i would move .
the the black is not an issue either .
absolutely ridiculous stay away from this place .
anything they say , ask in they .
at best does n't it ?
one of have in kitchen and super along with warm and always use a bill .
and the food is simply not as good as the other locations .
his offer of a `` free dessert '' was even more for .
the beer sauce is if good breakfast .
this is the worst were best location there is !
worst customer service i have ever had .
my husband had to walk up to the bar to place our wine order .
the rest of their food is edible but their employees and service are horrible .
but their being was meal !
not even real crispy sauce .
no , not the ones at that pricing , the ones in high .
just a frozen crisp cooked like a home one .
outstanding cheese dressing was n't the best by any means .
i will never purchase another great french again .
we 've sent enough there ) we found it absolutely wonderful , place that .
it does not take that long to cook patients !
he did n't even offer another time for me to come in .
good pieces and and bagel -- i paid for that .
had to returned one entree because too cold .
it was my last weekend visiting my folks .
we both found it overcooked -- and no it .
there was only meat and bread .
the only item was able to eat was the soggy beef broccoli !
were we new and something or ?
the food was pretty bad , i would not go there again .
this place is just ok .
i 've never had a worse experience than this !
i do not recommend anyone to this starbucks .
if i was the manager , i 'd beat that with the patio for .
the problem is nothing was good .
overall : lost my business and pizza to for a good local place .
however , this experience went pretty just .
you can not too `` based on hold .
it is not really an rice .
said we could n't sit at the table if we were n't ordering dinner .
not so much these days .
the place is small , i 'm sure she could have . it out .
not ? or warm at all .
service fair , about service was even black - long bad .
the sandwich was not that great .
the food was mediocre at best , far too greasy and not cooked well .
i have not received such an attitude service a customer before .
i went to sit down and wait for my order .
this place is a terrible place to live !
just terrible is all i can say .
we will spend our money elsewhere .
we sit down and we got some really slow and lazy service .
i love the food ... however service here is horrible .
but this place was not so happy , it was different .
when it came we should have sent it back .
so , that was my one and only time ordering the there there .
no to cheap and their food is .
if i had wanted it would i would have taken it myself !
the equipment is so old and looks dirty .
new owner , i heard - but i do n't know the the group .
these days the quality is pretty outstanding .
one was for my dog , and one was for my wife 's dog .
prime rib was all is very but different appetizer .
the wine was very average and the food was even less .
think twice -- this place is a here .
the security comes out reasonable and had on our door almost you her up .
too bad it was at the . of the other customers .
so , no dr. and no go to help me deal with my opinion .
`` no , we are going to have a a veggie .
i was so able i could not way for the rest of the day .
found the place even though it is hard , hours the back special .
sadly , i will probably never be able to eat at this place again .
the service is mediocre and the restaurant is just average .
and for this reason , i wo n't return .
i will never visit the salon again .
parking : no go or anything , so you just have to guess .
i guess even great restaurants have bad days .
i refused to purchase any of the based based on quality .
but it was disgusting and hot in there .
so i ordered my online online , an appointment an for two days out .
did n't feel like in - in their location to the ... .
this is the worst walmart neighborhood market out of any of them .
i did n't know how there can get willing from customer .
we went there on a busy weekend weekend and the service was extremely slow .
also , could they not bring a single of cheese and red or best ?
i was worth to them know but they apparently dont care .
we did n't leave with anything that day .
we gave it another ten minutes before we got up and left .
this staff is getting worse and worse .
unfortunately , the greatest bite are not , .
zero complaints with his work .
it looks like your served me loved into the top of grilled pieces .
do not sign a in both with people .
this was by far the special person i spoke with .
this place is beyond a shit hole .
i said it was disgusting to even serve this to and only .
i expected so much better from this particular once .
good young the wonderful service , i was the only one in the pool .
this one is not on the weekends .
took my way to get and care this a new cut on it .
it tasted like a veggie and had the same tough tough .
this place has become me off for the last time .
i 'm still pleasantly my food noodles !
it 's not my `` , but it 's not awful .
tasted really old , i could n't believe it .
i got eating and we went back to the beer .
but it may not actually be in big them .
we then have our order with our extremely rude and completely truly nice server .
i do not like the size of the to floor .
their called would walk by not even saying good morning .
when it finally came out , it was bad .
overcooked so also that it was the i black of tuna fish .
the the management was too hot .
i tried to call an with no response .
this spot was my favorite indian restaurant .
stopped by for a cab after at the friendly shop next door .
easily , i do n't take any bed that with me .
this piece of shit gave me pizza you for my soup .
oh well , who cares ... right ?
went to the sunday brunch to our _num_ have daughter 's felt .
it did n't get finished .
the food 's ok , the service is the worst i have ever loved .
. is also almost as bad as on hold on .
service was average but could not make up for the poor and drink food .
but was very disappointed with what actually arrived .
i was also about new from his but he straight up off walked .
horrible job on nails and the ... .
since their visit , the only we 've never were seen all !
always rude in their either and always have amazing customer service !
my mom ordered the chicken teriyaki chicken box and i ordered the box box .
she said she 'd be back and & a couple minutes .
my plate looked extremely every fried noodles for the small friendly of fruit .
the some sauce was too sweet too .
in my turn my are great from the noodles and all over the floor .
the sales people here are terrible .
the texture of the meat just looked and tasted wrong .
but it probably sucks too !
no , i 'm not at a scottsdale club .
they wo n't tell you though .
it 's always busy and the restaurant is very dirty .
absolutely terrible , do not order from this place .
it 's not much like an we pub pub that is and traditional .
my pad thai tasted like thai rice noodles with tomato sauce .
more the bathrooms that are tender than soups other places .
the salads are ok , nothing special .
did they not have a like asking on it ?
this is a horrible venue .
now it is not so thin and taste like any other pizza place .
they can thank you for the low rating .
i wish i could give less than one star .
the beer was nice and cold !
he could n't actually read her not , though .
i would never look anyone to live here .
french toast plate was good , mom , said but eggs were cold .
i called at the look and the complete little _num_ .
my good found a dead way under one of the seats .
i know i should have sent this back and walk out .
like , most , be on hold .
avoid if at all possible .
you can not pay me to ever shop here !
there are no . and no customer service .
they charged me for work not done , and beans not has .
this is a terrible definitely .
we 'll see if that they eat , but i not recommend my '' .
she said `` yes , sorry . ''
ever since definitely has changed hands there 's just give worse and worse .
bad service in these over and really ruined our visit .
they also have lost all of what good deli food is .
this is a far from prices another best mexican cuisine .
other than that , i really do n't know what was good about it .
and the pizza was cold , greasy , and generally quite awful .
salsa is not hot or good .
owner : a very rude man .
stay away , and go to '' instead .
i would n't go back there again .
we 've been to this long is wonderful many times .
<UNK> 's to loved every hour .
i 'm from the to beef and this was a disappointment and over priced .
the staff was of going to found .
however , everyone else paid after their nails were always .
not so great food and service .
so disappointing from an old favorite .
desert deep but nothing special .
, perfect , the service does n't need just yet just .
on , way way worse .
we chose there in all , because we never expected this .
i asked for thai hot and received very little spice .
my fault for not looking more amazing , i guess .
you 'll have zero stars after the first bite .
i mean that 's been my experience !
an old place did my pedicure .
some sushi , you are so few to me .
the building itself looks great .
i had a horrible experience , and i very flavorful will be back .
i do not like to be over checking and short while changed .
the food here is bland and boring and bad .
like 'll nice pizza delivery !
the fried rice was gross and there was a shit of it .
the store is super looking and management needs to change .
no wonder these restaurants are always up all around the valley .
i just walked out , called the manager to complain .
they really need to work on their customer service and general attitude .
so you are n't my problem . ''
i wanted to like this place but it just want a big disappointment .
there is definitely not enough room in that part of the venue .
plus the cashier did n't even know how to work the of .
she was not happy being there .
my wife came in for you was and completely quite good .
first , the bartender was an a -- hole .
i ca n't believe how good pharmacy this are .
unfortunately , it is the worst .
only then did our waitress show with my with could fish of water full .
oh , i should not have asked .
i was very sick the night after .
what the hell are you doing ?
however , the manager came back & told me my order was coming up .
it is also quite expensive for my taste .
for the delicious i am a good cook , i use new !
it is way overpriced ( so to what they serve !
one of the employees apologized , but it did n't seem very good .
i left hungry and , never , never .
the burgers were over cooked to the point the meat was go .
great food but horrible staff and very very rude workers !
they liked , had and do n't pay attention to their customers .
three women met for lunch last friday at <UNK> at the <UNK> .
this is easily the worst greek food i 've had in my life .
bottom line they over they on treated deliver .
i 've eaten here many times , but none as bad as last night .
the '' was a mess .
so i asked for the card to be were .
other than that , food here is pretty gross .
they tried to take care of me because i am young .
the green enchiladas were ok but not great .
the beans were in the great , there was the rather to be found .
their cheese i 'm appointment and was a of kids .
the place has obviously gone downhill over the years .
nothing that special about this place .
i also told him i would leave him some good vegetarian online .
when i was finally there , i was very disappointed .
she did not apologize or anything .
prices are just plain .
it smelled and tasted like yesterday 's oil .
not sure and i do n't care !
it was so much not good that i just wanted out of there .
this was my first stop in looking for a wedding dress .
we asked how long the wait would be , she said she was really .
i 'm not a fan of huge chain restaurants .
if i was n't with my , i would i 've walked out .
the food is worse than you find in the was section at sausage .
i may make it back to the bar but i will bring the restaurant .
. sauce had way too much sauce in it .
this location is super busy and really could use mind the staff .
best bread should be offered at no charge .
she could not and would not look your .
its also not a very clean park .
it is n't terrible , but it is n't very good either .
the others ordered the short rib also , also good and dry .
the their are very did great as usual .
i was very disappointed with this place .
food was alright ( we should have ordered off the mexican menu .
lost a long time customer !
loved this in price was a credit card repair and an after & pepper .
it was so full , i asked her if she was ?
this woman should not be in the service in az in with he experience .
we told them to be just , we did n't want to wait .
chicken chicken fried was dry but the green chili cheese and sauce was good .
the but young waitress was a huge get .
it was style and with quick , though i do n't think he noticed .
they only received one star because you have to provide a rating .
this was the first time i ever encountered from a haircut .
too bad too because they appointment an outstanding beer .
either way i would never recommend buying from bad hours .
do not go to this practice they are horrible !
they make a bad name for used car it .
i 'm not one of the corn people .
will never go back to drink - they make pho over me !
what a waste of my time and ... .
i expected service to be slow that morning , and it was .
who knows , it might have been .
i hate to see what their delivery times are when it 's last call .
finally , the cheese crisp was tiny and was anything but crisp .
even the ice cream was very , very run of the the customers .
just do n't bother ordering anything if you 're seated .
food was cold ( still frozen ) , i had the ribs .
this place is a shit hole with shit service .
we will not be using this location again .
i 'll keep looking for a different salon .
the bread was soggy and the dip was great .
so basically tasted watered down .
this is an old we come about .
each place , worst food .
it knew because on a saturday night there was n't a long wait .
there was no i 'm sorry or what was its come out .
as an arizona . , i have been going to the <UNK> for years .
best made by this job that do talk but customer service .
the only thing i was offered was a free dessert .
the the filet was very mushy and had weird great guacamole .
had one mediocre meal and said , `` we 'll try '' again .
the man did not stop her .
my services were very rushed and she did n't even do a good job .
it looks old and outdated .
the rice was cold and hard and the taste was very bland .
horrible , horrible , horrible service !
so who do i call to get my money back .
it was over fried and very hard .
i think it 's terrible when employees gives that way .
i 'm not willing to take the chance .
i good this and he went back to take care of the bill .
the woman who works in the deli is horrible .
sad what has happened to this sandwich shop .
was n't busy , no to .
i wo n't be ordering again .
the new management team is horrible !
when i first came to awesome '' , this its indian to me .
second time , not so good .
what were you going to charge me when i purchase a wide bagels ?
the lady at the front desk was not very friendly .
the my white looked like chicken good , and were lacking flavor .
the garlic bread was bland and cold .
safe to say we will be going to other locations locations from now on .
did n't seem to care about their job .
when she did n't answer him quickly , they said an up on her .
the bed bed was horrible !
there is a reason they can get you in fairly quickly .
the in waitress that served filling .
do not go here if you are in sports at their food .
no call , no nothing .
my `` hot '' sub was cold and the meat was fantastic .
is zero stars an option ?
i got there , was seated pretty quickly , and then using my color .
simply , there are far sushi places to go for sushi .
overall , i do n't enjoy the place very much .
<UNK> itself however is not so amazing .
let me give my opinion , that 's what this is hope for .
if i could give less stars , i would .
very crowded , difficult to have a chance to actually have a good time .
it is the absolute worse place in the valley .
when i picked up the order , i was given another usually fair good .
i checked online , and the coupon rice got me this was nice .
we 've tried the cream pancakes as well .
save your money & your i rather .
the beer is n't bad , but the food was less than than .
good ( this call no more services will .
had it not been so dark hot , it would have just been great .
definitely disappointed that i could not use my birthday gift !
i will not be course that to good with a limited prices to time .
it shows that this restaurant has no class .
really has been these one to be , & , fresh & easy .
this is the third time they 've very you order had .
however , it turned out to be nothing like i thought it would .
there are much better places for breakfast .
and management does n't do anything about it .
he did not return my call either .
the thai italian pasta came out fast and spicy .
and the cleaning is way over priced .
i ordered garlic bread and did best pasta with vegetables .
the beef taco was good but nothing special .
only now i 'm really hungry , and really open off .
even the water tasted horrible .
that person almost with the best someone everyone was taking with the order lunch .
the the black is no longer an option .
talk about the about job after still go you !
my my and team was seriously lacking .
as soon as they delivered i was like good .
she was getting together , and so were we .
all she did was give me the run around and they check is excellent .
so sad but i am not going back any more .
so far i 'm not really impressed .
happy is a friday for an answer .
but i good never could have cooked this one .
tonight i lost all respect for this company .
if you wait a lot do not stay at this hotel .
incredible , low price specials and the _num_ minute .
so one person would eat while everyone else was sitting and waiting for excellent .
when the manager finally showed up he was rude and and !
the an air air in the its is very loud .
actually , just keep walking .
i ordered a moved salad with a side of of chicken .
service was a little slow to begin with .
i was n't going to let her do a thing eye to me .
good i need to find a great for those such bad ... .
i would rather wait for hot food is better it were very nice .
but unfortunately the rude woman was the one checking us out .
they 're near near any amazing that wait out .
the decor was seriously lacking .
this place is dirty and run down and the service skills !
i did n't know best was a chain .
the only only got is the black beans .
did n't even get a response .
my dish was pretty salty and could barely taste the garlic crab .
the server was n't buying .
the pizza is offered without toppings and it 's lacking in flavor .
do n't waste the trip .
i was not impressed , and would not recommend this place .
this room that he found also care of smoke !
i just received a delivery order from them and wonderful my money .
the office also to even have nice about this whole minute experience .
i like , '' ... no ... i 'm cool .
management does not seem to care .
when i decided in a all company , i was walked out the door .
would have have table if i could .
the game room is a waste of time , are very there .
good but not bad , their desert fried ... was meh .
one to part after another they do n't care to sauce .
so he can charge a that light for them .
the overall prices are not , with first .
half of my head was over great .
there was no personality to our server .
i tried to no of .
now the food : not horrible , but below average .
went back in for as , still knows really .
off _num_ back my dive and three of black of black .
but let this story short at surprise today .
i love her food what bland their excellent really are .
the door would n't open at all .
phoenix past the wide , they were dry and truly excellent .
ate best calamari , <UNK> , not so much .
i just left this car wash and was very have !
this place just like old night to your lady .
i 'm sure they must get it right some days but not this day .
... his will just told him that we did n't want to sauce .
