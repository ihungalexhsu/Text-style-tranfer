i guess starbucks customer services is only good at some locations .
the evening started out slow .
let me tell you , this place was far from busy !
i dont know why i was expecting anything different .
i guess she was n't happy that we were asking the prices .
at this location the service was terrible .
very disappointed and would stay clear of this place .
if i could give zero stars i def would .
wendy 's has been know to be cheap with their drink refills for years .
what about the time i wasted ?
she did offer me a copy if i would like a soda while waiting .
it 's just too expensive for what you get .
there are better happy hours and better beers all around mill !
she does n't say anything and just walks away .
also , the food that is there is n't great even by buffet standards .
the woman did n't even apologize .
they failed to tell us eating in the bar was an option .
the food was low quality and thrown together quickly with little flavor .
two hours of my life i can never get back .
management no longer cares about the golf experience .
just went back to get the rear tire sealed and filled .
she just grabbed a couple empty dishes and walked off .
as for the food , never had it .
service was just as disappointing .
the food was so-so and very over priced for what you get .
but the customer service ruins it all for me .
needless to say , i contacted the store manager directly after leaving .
no massage with my manicure or pedicure .
i had to leave a message , and they never called me back .
you wo n't find a better selection in scottsdale .
needless to say i will not be back for mexican food .
overall it was a miserable evening .
the charge did include miso soup and a small salad .
crab cakes , salt , no other flavor .
is that a good thing or a bad thing ?
seriously though , i have never shopped here .
the cash register area was empty and no one was watching the store front .
the bathroom area is nothing special .
even if i was insanely drunk , i could n't force this pizza down .
maybe they were having a bad night ?
like it 's been in a fridge for a week .
the food is not that authentic .
do n't go here unless you want to pay for crap .
i did n't even eat it .
you are not the only place in town with decent pizza .
my groupon is only for the two windows .
in the long run , they did absolutely nothing for me .
had to wait a month to get in .
then he proceeded to tell me how to fix it .
this is the reason i will never go back .
always takes way too long even if you 're the only one there .
i may just post pictures to prove their shoddy work .
however , the tech said nothing to me about this .
i should have stuck with sun chinese dining .
yes , the portions were large , but size is n't everything .
i have to say i was truly disappointed .
his egg sandwiches stink like feet and are slimy .
maria the manager is a horrible person .
the only thing we received that was hot was the coffee .
just left and took it off the bill .
the rooms are not that nice and the food is not that good either .
they tried real hard to get me to come back but i refused .
furthermore , there is no sausage or bacon on the menu .
no stars is what in want to give .
i looked around and there were still customers .
we will not be coming back .
it did n't matter of she is good at all other times .
went into this location to drop it off .
the food is n't too bad but the service is terrible .
so , it went in the trash .
next dish was moo goo gai pan to which the sauce is the secret .
anyway , we got our coffee and will not return to this location .
needless to say , i will not be returning to this place ever again .
they do not stock some of the most common parts .
if your patio is south facing , you 're out of luck .
there chips are ok , but their salsa is really bland .
when i arrived , no one was at the desk .
so i brought my business elsewhere .
the birthday surprise has been ruined as well as her special day .
i 'm stuck in a lease otherwise i would move .
the tow package is not an issue either .
absolutely ridiculous stay away from this place .
anything they say , ask in writing .
sounds good does n't it ?
built in cabinets in kitchen and bathroom along with sink are not kept up .
and the food is simply not as good as the other locations .
his offer of a `` free dessert '' was even more atrocious .
the beer sauce is lackluster at best .
this is the worst panda express location there is !
worst customer service i have ever had .
my husband had to walk up to the bar to place our wine order .
the rest of their food is edible but their employees and service are horrible .
but their inventory was questionable !
not even real brown sauce .
no , not the ones at asu , the ones in junior high .
just a frozen patty cooked like a home one .
blue cheese dressing was n't the best by any means .
i will never purchase another lv bag again .
we 've sent enough guests there who have returned absolutely livid with this restaurant .
it does not take that long to cook sliders !
he did n't even offer another time for me to come in .
uneven pieces and falling apart -- i paid for that .
had to returned one entree because too cold .
it was my last weekend visiting my folks .
we both found it overcooked -- and no seasonings .
there was only meat and bread .
the only item was able to eat was the soggy broccoli beef !
were we irritating her or something ?
the food was pretty bad , i would not go there again .
this place is just ok .
i 've never had a worse experience than this !
i do not recommend anyone to this starbucks .
if i was the manager , i 'd fire that kid on the spot .
the problem is nothing was good .
overall : lost my business and recommendation for a good local camera place .
however , this experience went pretty smooth .
you can not judge people based on appearance .
it is not really brown rice .
said we could n't sit at the table if we were n't ordering dinner .
not so much these days .
the place is small , i 'm sure she could have figured it out .
not personalized or warm at all .
service fair , pace was bad between courses - long waits .
the sandwich was not that great .
the food was mediocre at best , far too greasy and not cooked well .
i have not received such an attitude toward a customer before .
i went to sit down and wait for my order .
this place is a terrible place to live !
just terrible is all i can say .
we will spend our money elsewhere .
we sit down and we got some really slow and lazy service .
i love the food ... however service here is horrible .
but this place was not economical so the expectation was different .
when it came we should have sent it back .
so , that was my one and only time ordering the benedict there .
no courtesy and their food is pathetic .
if i had wanted it washed i would have washed it myself !
the equipment is so old and looks dirty .
new owner , i heard - but i do n't know the details .
these days the quality is pretty lousy .
one was for my dog , and one was for my wife 's dog .
prime rib was fatty and not cooked per requested .
the wine was very average and the food was even less .
think twice -- this place is a dump .
the security guard comes upstairs and pounds on our door demanding we open up .
too bad it was at the expense of the other customers .
so , no treatment and no medication to help me deal with my condition .
`` no , we are going to have a tournament tomorrow .
i was so disgusted i could not way for the rest of the day .
found the place even though it is hard due to bad signage .
sadly , i will probably never be able to eat at this place again .
the service is mediocre and the restaurant is just average .
and for this reason , i wo n't return .
i will never visit the salon again .
parking : no signs or anything , so you just have to guess .
i guess even great restaurants have bad days .
i refused to purchase any of the pictures based on quality .
but it was disgusting and hot in there .
so i ordered my tires online , scheduled an appointment for two days out .
did n't feel like dealing with the restaurants closer to asu .
this is the worst walmart neighborhood market out of any of them .
i did n't know worker there can get tips from customer .
we went there on a busy holiday weekend and the service was extremely slow .
also , could they not bring a single pack of cheese or red peppers ?
i emailed to let them know but they apparently dont care .
we did n't leave with anything that day .
we gave it another 5-10 minutes before we got up and left .
this branch is getting worse and worse .
unfortunately , the tour guides are not experts .
zero complaints with his work .
it looks like blended up chicken put into the shape of grilled pieces .
do not sign a lease with these people .
this was by far the rudest person i spoke with .
this place is beyond a shit hole .
i said it was disgusting to even serve this to diners .
i expected so much better from this ny staple .
20-30 % capacity at most , i was the only one in the pool .
this one is not on the ball .
took my suite to get fitted and a new button put on it .
it tasted like melted plastic and had the same tough consistency .
this place has pissed me off for the last time .
i 'm still craving my drunken noodles !
it 's not my fave , but it 's not awful .
tasted really old , i could n't believe it .
i skipped eating and we went back to the beer .
but it may not actually be in stock anyway .
we then placed our order with our extremely rude and apparently completely overwhelmed server .
i do not like the size of the dance floor .
executive chefs would walk by not even saying good morning .
when it finally came out , it was bad .
overcooked so badly that it was the consistency of canned tuna fish .
the espresso was way too hot .
i tried to call repeatedly with no response .
this spot was my favorite indian restaurant .
stopped by for soda after being at the hobby shop next door .
hopefully , i do n't take any bed bugs with me .
this piece of shit gave me wonton crackers for my soup .
oh well , who cares ... right ?
went to the sunday brunch to celebrate our daughter 's college graduation .
it did n't get finished .
the food 's ok , the service is among the worst i have encountered .
university is also almost as bad as living on apache .
service was average but could not make up for the poor food and drink .
but was very disappointed with what actually arrived .
i was also curious about another product but he straight up walked off .
horrible job on nails and toes .
since their visit , the only scorpions we 've seen were dead !
always rude in their tone and always have shitty customer service !
my mom ordered the teriyaki chicken bento box and i ordered the sashimi box .
she said she 'd be back and disappeared for a few minutes .
my plate looked nearly half empty except for the small container of cole slaw .
the dipping sauce was too sweet too .
in turn my legs are burnt from the noodles and all over the floor .
the sales people here are terrible .
the texture of the meat just looked and tasted wrong .
but it probably sucks too !
no , i 'm not at a scottsdale club .
they wo n't tell you though .
it 's always busy and the restaurant is very dirty .
absolutely terrible , do not order from this place .
it 's not much like an actual irish pub , which is depressing .
my pad thai tasted like thai rice noodles with barbeque sauce .
firstly , their fees are generally higher than other places .
the salads are ok , nothing special .
did they not have a fountain machine on site ?
this is a horrible venue .
now it is not so thin and taste like any other pizza place .
they can thank you for the low rating .
i wish i could give less than one star .
the beer was nice and cold !
he could n't actually read her pressure , though .
i would never reccomend anyone to live here .
french toast plate was good , mom said , but eggs were cold .
i called at 6:30 and got the complete brush off .
my toddler found a dead mouse under one of the seats .
i know i should have sent this back and walk out .
liar , liar , pants on fire .
avoid if at all possible .
you can not pay me to ever shop here !
there are no smiles and no customer service .
they charged me for work not done , and parts not installed .
this is a terrible college .
we 'll see if that happens , but i 'm not holding my breath .
she said `` yes , sorry . ''
ever since joes has changed hands it 's just gotten worse and worse .
bad service in these areas and really ruined our visit .
they also have lost sight of what good deli food is .
this is a far cry from real new mexican cuisine .
other than that , i really do n't know what was good about it .
and the pizza was cold , greasy , and generally quite awful .
salsa is not hot or good .
owner : a very rude man .
stay away , and go to cheesecake instead .
i would n't go back there again .
we 've been to this long established restaurant many times .
<UNK> 's failed on every occasion .
i 'm from the bay area and this was a disappointment and over priced .
the staff was nowhere to be found .
however , everyone else paid after their nails were completed .
not so great food and service .
so disappointing from an old favorite .
desert followed but nothing special .
um , yah , it does n't need replacing just yet .
nope , way way worse .
we stood there in shock , because we never expected this .
i asked for thai hot and received very little spice .
my fault for not looking more closely , i guess .
you 'll have zero appetite after the first bite .
i mean that 's been my experience !
an old dude did my pedicure .
ra sushi , you are so blah to me .
the building itself looks abandoned .
i had a horrible experience , and i sadly would not come back .
i do not like to be screwed over , or short changed .
the food here is bland and boring and bad .
sketchy sketchy sketchy pizza delivery !
the fried rice was gross and there was a shit load of it .
the store is dumpy looking and management needs to change .
no wonder these restaurants are closing up all around the valley .
i just walked out , called the manager to complain .
they really need to work on their customer service and general attitude .
so you are n't my problem . ''
i wanted to like this place but it just became a big disappointment .
there is definitely not enough room in that part of the venue .
plus the dude did n't even know how to work the computer .
she was not happy being there .
my wife came in for alterations and was treated quite rudely .
first , the bartender was an a -- hole .
i ca n't believe how inconsiderate this pharmacy is .
unfortunately , it is the worst .
only then did our waitress show up with another styrofoam cup full of water .
oh , i should not have asked .
i was very sick the night after .
what the hell are you doing ?
however , the manager came back & told me my order was coming up .
it is also quite expensive for my taste .
for the record i am a good cook , i use seasoning !
it is way overpriced ( compare to what they serve !
one of the employees apologized , but it did n't seem very sincere .
i left hungry and unsatisfied , never again .
the burgers were over cooked to the point the meat was crunchy .
great food but horrible staff and very very rude workers !
they rush , rush and do n't pay attention to their customers .
three women met for lunch last friday at <UNK> at the <UNK> .
this is easily the worst greek food i 've had in my life .
bottom line they over promise and under deliver .
i 've eaten here many times , but none as bad as last night .
the restroom was a mess .
so i asked for the card to be refunded .
other than that , food here is pretty gross .
they tried to take advantage of me because i am young .
the green enchiladas were ok but not great .
the beans were in the burro in the rice was nowhere to be found .
their cheese i 'm certain was of the string variety .
the place has obviously gone downhill over the years .
nothing that special about this place .
i also told him i would leave him some good feedback online .
when i was finally there , i was very disappointed .
she did not apologize or anything .
prices are just plain retail .
it smelled and tasted like yesterday 's oil .
not sure and i do n't care !
it was so much not good that i just wanted out of there .
this was my first stop in looking for a wedding dress .
we asked how long the wait would be , she said she was unsure .
i 'm not a fan of huge chain restaurants .
if i was n't with my coworker , i would 've walked out .
the food is worse than you find in the freezer section at walmart .
i may make it back to the bar but i will skip the restaurant .
tzatziki sauce had way too much dill in it .
this location is super busy and really could use double the staff .
perhaps bread should be offered at no charge .
she could not and would not explain herself .
its also not a very clean park .
it is n't terrible , but it is n't very good either .
the others ordered the short rib hash , also over-cooked and dry .
the mechanics are very amateur as usual .
i was very disappointed with this place .
food was alright maybe we should have ordered off the mexican menu .
lost a long time customer !
included in this price was a credit card fee and an after midnight fee .
it was so odd , i asked her if she was joking ?
this woman should not be in the service industry in az with that attitude .
we told them to forget it , we did n't want to wait .
chicken fried chicken was dry but the green chili macaroni and cheese was good .
the surly older waitress was a huge bummer .
it was embarrassing for all involved , though i do n't think he noticed .
they only received one star because you have to provide a rating .
this was the first time i ever cried from a haircut .
too bad too because they brew an outstanding beer .
either way i would never recommend buying from camping world .
do not go to this practice they are horrible !
they make a bad name for used car dealers .
i 'm not one of the corn people .
will never go back to kfc - they essentially stole from me !
what a waste of my time and theirs .
i expected service to be slow that morning , and it was .
who knows , it might have been .
i hate to see what their delivery times are when it 's last call .
finally , the cheese crisp was tiny and was anything but crisp .
even the ice cream was very , very run of the mill .
just do n't bother ordering anything if you 're seated .
food was cold ( still frozen ) , i had the ribs .
this place is a shit hole with shit service .
we will not be using this location again .
i 'll keep looking for a different salon .
the bread was soggy and the dip was inedible .
so basically tasted watered down .
this is an old worn out hotel .
pathetic place , worst food .
it shows because on a saturday night there was n't a long wait .
there was no i 'm sorry or how did everything come out .
as an arizona native , i have been going to the <UNK> for years .
staffed primarily by teenagers that do n't understand customer service .
the only thing i was offered was a free dessert .
the chow mein was very mushy and had weird texture .
had one mediocre meal and said , `` we 'll try again '' .
the man did not stop her .
my services were very rushed and she did n't even do a good job .
it looks old and outdated .
the rice was cold and hard and the taste was very bland .
horrible , horrible , horrible service !
so who do i call to get my money back .
it was over fried and very hard .
i think it 's terrible when employees act that way .
i 'm not willing to take the chance .
i acknowledged this and he went back to take care of the bill .
the woman who works in the deli is horrible .
sad what has happened to this sandwich shop .
was n't busy , no biggie .
i wo n't be ordering again .
the new management team is horrible !
when i first came to phx ... yes this sounded indian to me .
second time , not so good .
what were you going to charge me when i purchase a dozen bagels ?
the lady at the front desk was not very friendly .
the falafel 's looked like chicken nuggets , and were lacking flavor .
the garlic bread was bland and cold .
safe to say we will be going to other walgreens locations from now on .
did n't seem to care about their job .
when she did n't answer him quickly enough , he hung up on her .
the queen bed was horrible !
there is a reason they can get you in fairly quickly .
the wonton was seriously lacking filling .
do not go here if you are interested in eating good food .
no call , no nothing .
my `` hot '' sub was cold and the meat was watery .
is zero stars an option ?
i got there , was seated pretty quickly , and then chose my color .
simply , there are far superior places to go for sushi .
overall , i do n't enjoy the place very much .
<UNK> itself however is not so amazing .
let me give my opinion , that 's what this site is for .
if i could give less stars , i would .
very crowded , difficult to have a chance to actually have a good time .
it is the absolute worse place in the valley .
when i picked up the order , i was given another totally different price .
i checked online , and the coupon site said my certificate was good .
we 've tried the cream pancakes as well .
save your money & your patience .
the beer is n't bad , but the food was less than desirable .
exhibit c : no more student services peeps .
had it not been so terribly hot , it would have just been inconvenient .
definitely disappointed that i could not use my birthday gift !
i will not revisit this course as a visitor with limited time to play .
it shows that this restaurant has no class .
safeway has officially lost my business to sprouts , & fresh & easy .
this is the third time they 've messed up that spice .
however , it turned out to be nothing like i thought it would .
there are much better places for breakfast .
and management does n't do anything about it .
he did not return my call either .
the thai basil pasta came out lukewarm and spicy .
and the cleaning is way over priced .
i ordered garlic bread and fettuccine alfredo pasta with vegetables .
the beef taco was good but nothing special .
only now i 'm really hungry , and really pissed off .
even the water tasted horrible .
that person didnt get their meal until everyone else was finished with their meal .
the associates program is no longer an option .
talk about false advertising so call before you go !
my jack and coke was seriously lacking .
as soon as they delivered i was like ugh .
she was getting pissed , and so were we .
all she did was give me the run around and lied and bs everything .
so sad but i am not going back any more .
so far i 'm not really impressed .
meanwhile i 'm waiting for an answer .
but i darn sure could have cooked this one .
tonight i lost all respect for this company .
if you travel a lot do not stay at this hotel .
incredible , low price specials and the occasional groupon .
so one person would eat while everyone else was sitting and waiting for theirs .
when the manager finally showed up he was rude and dismissive !
the ceiling air conditioner in the hallway is very loud .
actually , just keep walking .
i ordered a cesar salad with a side of blackened chicken .
service was a little slow to begin with .
i was n't going to let her do a thing further to me .
geez i need to find a source for those uni blocks ... .
i would rather wait for hot food than have it cold and soggy .
but unfortunately the rude woman was the one checking us out .
they 're nowhere near any fight that breaks out .
the decor was seriously lacking .
this place is dirty and run down and the service stinks !
i did n't know ra was a chain .
the only saving grace was the black beans .
did n't even get a response .
my dish was pretty salty and could barely taste the garlic crab .
the server was n't buying .
the pizza is offered without toppings and it 's lacking in flavor .
do n't waste the trip .
i was not impressed , and would not recommend this place .
this room that he found also reeked of smoke !
i just received a delivery order from them and essentially wasted my money .
the office also failed to even apologize about this whole horrific experience .
i replied , '' um ... no i 'm cool .
management does not seem to care .
when i complained in a polite way , i was walked out the door .
would have rated lower if i could .
the game room is a waste of time , energy and money .
lastly but not least , their brownie desert was ... meh .
one broken thing after another they do n't care to address .
so he can charge a bloody fortune for them .
the overall prices are not competitive with frys .
half of my head was over processed .
there was no personality to our server .
i tried to no avail .
now the food : not horrible , but below average .
went back in for adjustment , realized still incorrect .
dropped off my red purse and three pair of black shoes .
but let this story begin at noon today .
i suppose id forgotten how bland their offerings really are .
the door would n't open at all .
moving past the shape , they were dry and truly tasteless .
ate kicked ass , <UNK> , not so much .
i just left this car wash and was very unsatisfied !
this place smelt like old urine for some reason .
i 'm sure they must get it right some days but not this day .
um ... we just told him that we did n't want to finance .
