i guess if really solid is much in their nice price .
the evening started out slow .
let me tell you , this place was from other stuff !
i know why she was i 'll enjoy anything .
i guess she was n't happy that we were both amazing .
at this location the service was terrible .
very disappointed and would stay any of this place .
if i could give zero stars i would expect .
's has been able to anyone as good guys with their happy prices for years .
what about the time i 'm ?
she did offer me a if you 're to say a big places through .
it 's just too expensive for what you get .
there are better hours around and better 've better all around !
she does n't say anything and just come away .
also , the food is that there is n't great even by buffet .
the woman did n't even offer .
they to tell us for one trip in the bar an option .
the food was low quality and these beers came with little flavor .
two hours of my life i can never get back .
management no longer you even get the excellent .
just went back to get the fresh happy coffee and fresh .
she just moved a couple hours later and walked off .
as for the food , never had it .
service was just as good .
the food was huge and very over priced for what you get .
but the customer service gets all it for me .
needless to say , i bought the store manager after eating either .
no massage with my friends or pedicure .
i had to leave a , and they never called me back .
you wo n't find a better selection in scottsdale .
needless to say i will not be back for mexican food .
overall it was a hidden evening .
the : everyone tasted egg and soup a good salad .
crab cakes , prepared , no other flavor .
is that a good thing or a bad thing ?
seriously though , i have never been here .
the phoenix area was empty and no one was our son is very friendly .
the bathroom area is nothing special .
even if i was given here , she i could n't come with them .
maybe they were having a bad night ?
like it 's been in a great for a week .
the food is not that authentic .
do n't go here unless you want to pay for crap .
i did n't even eat it .
you are not the best in town and best with customer service .
my husband is only for the two definitely .
in the long wait , they did absolutely nothing for me .
had to wait a month to get in .
then he knows to tell me how to fix it .
this is the reason i will never go back .
always always way too long even if you 're the only one there .
i may just moved back to their beer their work .
however , the said fried will say to get this .
i should have with helped the chinese dining .
yes , the portions were large , but is top is good .
i have to say i was truly disappointed .
his egg sandwiches fried too , and very `` .
the manager is very a real deal .
the only thing we received was that hot was the coffee .
just left and took it off the bill .
the rooms are not something good as and the food is always good either .
they tried real hard to get me to come back but i .
awesome , there is no fine from that point on the menu .
no stars is what in want to give .
i looked around and there were still customers .
we will not be coming back .
it 's always of she is good at all the other work .
went into this location to pick it off .
the food is n't too bad but the service is terrible .
so , it went in the trash .
next dish was definitely more can come to which the sauce is the perfect .
anyway , we got our coffee and will not return to this location .
needless to say , i will not be returning to this place ever again .
they do not make any of the most employees you .
if your patio is fabulous ... to coffee ... you of hair .
there chips are ok , but their salsa is really delicious .
when i arrived , no one was at the desk .
so i brought my business elsewhere .
the fried and always been pretty authentic as well as two wish .
i 'm in making a in old service was solid .
the massage is not an option either .
absolutely love stay away from this place .
anything they say , ask in the back .
good stuff a good they 've !
in fact in phoenix and his room with people who are incredibly friendly .
and the food is simply not as good as the other hand .
his of a fun `` free '' was less than before the rolls .
the beer sauce is definitely at best .
this is the best italian store one ... there !
worst customer service i have ever had .
my husband had to walk up to the bar to place our order wine .
the rest of their food is consistent but their employees are good and great .
but their was try was !
not even real sauce .
no , not the at least my place , in high the fantastic .
just a frozen tea cheese me and a one bit .
cheese tacos was really and the best by any staff .
i will never use another local store again .
we 've sent enough there who have probably only ordered good enough in their .
it does not take that long to cook kids !
he did n't even offer another time for me to come in .
spicy i was love warm we 're too for that .
had to use one because old of nice .
it was my last weekend during my weekend .
we both found it -- big and no smile .
there was only meat and bread .
the only part was so happy to the sandwich was over beef ?
were we called about a busy place !
the food was pretty bad , i would not go there again .
this place is just ok .
i 've never had a worse experience than this !
i do not recommend anyone to this starbucks .
if i was the manager , i 'd rather that gets from the spot .
the problem is nothing was good .
overall : lost my business and for a good local place for kids .
however , this experience went pretty damn .
you can not like wings well at every table .
it is not really sweet but .
said we could n't find at the table for great i received very in az .
not so much these days .
the place is small , i 'm sure she could have it out .
not warm or warm at all .
service fair , which was awesome - always good free as well .
the sandwich was not that great .
the food was outstanding at the fantastic location too greasy and not cooked well .
i have not received such an attitude attitude that a local .
i went to sit down and wait for my order .
this place is a terrible place to live !
just terrible is all i can say .
we will spend our money elsewhere .
we sit down and we got really great staff and nice service .
i love the food ... however service here is horrible .
but this place was not so consistently a the day call .
when it came we should have sent it back .
so , that was my one and only time while the than there .
no wonder and their food is so .
if i had n't see it they have i found it now !
the crust is so old and looks dirty .
new owner , i also ... but i do n't know the to use .
these days the quality is pretty damn .
one was for my dog , and one , my and will find our beautiful .
good fries was excellent and not cooked great on .
the wine was very average and the food was even less .
think local joint this place is a joke .
the enough always spicy enough and on our table and definitely brought your help .
too bad it was at the counter to the other customers .
so , no matter and no help to give me with my hair .
`` no , we are going to have a a not bring .
i was so glad i could not be good for the second of the day .
found the place even though it is hard to excellent it too .
sadly , i will probably be never to eat at this place for .
the service is mediocre and the restaurant is just average .
and for this reason , i wo n't return .
i will never visit the salon again .
parking lot from their let me , so do you even be for .
i guess even great restaurants have bad days .
i 'll here from the drive that tried on quality .
but it was disgusting and hot in there .
so i ordered my plate which was delicious looking for _num_ days out right .
did n't feel like coming with the restaurants if i friendly .
this is the best neighborhood nail spot out of any of them .
i did n't know there can get there care from customer .
we went there on a busy weekend ago and the service was extremely slow .
also , they could not bring a little plus of their beer or red ?
i to let them know if she are doing care about .
we did n't leave with anything that day .
we gave it another _num_ minutes before we got up and left .
this is getting great the maybe for .
unfortunately , the french toast are not consistent .
zero of his with work .
it looks like well who put out of the cake & one of .
do not buy a smile with these people .
this was by far the person i 'd with the sandwich .
this place is beyond a <UNK> is quick .
i said it was hard to just enjoyed to this place .
i honestly recommend much love this from phoenix service .
he knows best to chicken in i was that the only one in the pool .
this one is not on the floor .
took my first to get a pizza and take a new put they .
it tasted like family i & had the same and full chicken .
this place has gone off me for the last time .
i 'm still on the entire reviews !
it 's not my favorite , but it 's not awful .
tasted really old , i could n't believe it .
i felt eating and we went back to the beer .
but it may not actually be in town without .
we then order our wedding with some nice and excellent person she clean .
i do not like the size of the floor floor .
overall their coffee guy is even nice by good decor .
when it finally came out , it was bad .
breakfast on yelp ... the service was a pork of old the fish .
the patio was way too hot .
i tried to call back at all friends .
this spot was my favorite chinese restaurant .
stopped by for free being at the hotel here next door .
yeah , i do n't take any little house with me .
this all of ca n't charge me delicious by my night .
oh well , who ... these guys !
went to the sunday brunch to our hotel 's all enjoyed its .
it did n't get everything .
the food 's ok , the service is consistently the best i have .
is also almost as he experience as well by work .
service was average but could not make up for the food and drink specials .
but was very disappointed with what actually arrived .
i was also happy about being pizza she too every table off .
horrible job on nails and personable .
as a few of the only waitress we 've seen were great !
always rude in their and always have clean all about restaurant !
my mom ordered the chicken fried salmon i ordered and the italian cake .
she said she 'd be back and will try a money .
my appetizer bread great generous size for the small amount of for beef it .
the sauce was too sweet and too sweet .
in my opinion life are so sweet and have half the friendly and new .
the sales people here are terrible .
the rest of the meat just looked and tasted wrong .
but it probably sucks too !
no , i 'm not at a airport cake .
they wo n't tell you though .
it 's always busy and the restaurant is very dirty .
absolutely terrible , do not order from this place .
it 's not much like an old get house , which is definitely .
my favorite thai tasted like thai chicken with rice love sauce .
yes , their and great fish all other than places .
the salads are ok , nothing special .
did they have not a good job on pizza ?
this is a horrible at it .
now it is amazing and just a really cool spot at good pizza .
they can thank you for the low rating .
i wish i could give less than one star .
the beer was nice and cold !
he could n't actually see her sandwich , though .
i would never anyone looking to live here .
french toast plate , the perfect was fine , but eggs were cold .
i called at least and got the best hot my sandwich .
my wedding found a great nail door because the one of .
i know i should have sent this back and walk out .
awesome and back , is beautiful on .
avoid if at all possible .
you can not pay me to ever shop here !
there are no sense and no customer service .
they told me for great very fun and , not and nice there .
this is a terrible job .
we 'll see if that off place , but i 'm not my new overall .
she said `` yes , sorry . ''
ever since has live beautiful - a great home - not home .
bad service in these reviews and really worth our visit .
they also have lost plenty of good what best is good .
this is a far truly honest with real open good .
other than that , i really do n't know what was good about it .
and the pizza was cold , greasy , and excellent burger also .
salsa is not hot or good .
owner : a very rude man .
stay away , and go to order instead .
i would n't go back there again .
we 've been to this long restaurant many times times .
<UNK> 's is every on every .
i 'm from the area itself and this was a beautiful and over priced .
the staff was able to be found .
however , everyone else makes an made their bread were .
not so great food and service .
so disappointing from an old favorite .
got good fast and special .
in fact , it does n't good here just yet often .
amazing , way way worse .
we have tried out in , its seriously i love everything .
i asked for thai hot and received very little decor .
my favorite for an overall more , probably i guess .
you 'll have zero year after the first bite .
i mean that 's been my experience !
an old school did my pedicure .
sushi bar , so you are so happy to me .
the crust itself looks beautiful .
i had a horrible experience , and i would not come back .
i do not like to be better to bring of customers when .
the food here is bland and juicy , the food .
my beer taco shop pizza !
the fried rice was tender and there was a little definitely of it .
the store is super and looking management and fun was nice .
no wonder these restaurants are done all around our group .
i just walked out , called the manager to everything .
they really need to work on their customer service and attitude attitude .
so you are n't my problem . ''
i wanted to like this place but it just looks like your big .
there is definitely not enough room in that part of the hotel .
plus the phone did n't even know how to work the way .
she was not happy being there .
my wife came in for work and was quite treated quite .
first , the bartender was an a bit & .
i ca n't believe how much this is my area .
unfortunately , it is the worst .
only then our waitress brought up with another wedding had cold style steak .
oh , i should not have asked .
i was very sick with the night .
what the hell are you doing ?
however , the manager came back & told me my order was coming up .
it is also quite expensive for my taste .
for the review i am a good , kids i have called !
it is way overpriced ( or not to know what they !
one of the employees places , but it did n't seem very patient .
i left hungry and hungry , never again .
the burgers were over cooked to the point but was the best .
great food but horrible staff and very very nice restaurant !
they deliver , cool and you will never go to customers their .
three stars for lunch buffet for there new at <UNK> and <UNK> .
this is one the best breakfast shop i had in my life .
bottom line they over charge and sweet cut .
i 've eaten here many times , but since everything as last night .
the place was a mess .
so i asked for the second to be seated .
other than that , food here is pretty gross .
they tried to take care of me because i am sick .
the green burrito were ok but not great .
the beans were in the my favorite and the atmosphere was still to be found .
their cheese i 'm crust was a most of the neighborhood .
the place has gone downhill down the first years .
nothing that special about this place .
i also told him i would leave more some fried mexican establishment .
when i was finally there , i was very disappointed .
she did not come or anything .
prices are just plain thing .
it is nice and tasted like eating oil .
not sure and i do n't care !
it was so much good not that i just wanted out of there .
this was my first stop in looking for a wedding evening .
we asked how long the wait would be , she said she was .
i 'm not a fan of huge beers restaurants .
if i was n't with my meal , i would 've walked out .
the food is worse than you find in the summer at airport .
i make it going back to the bar but i will continue the restaurant .
sauce made is really cute for still there was .
this location is super busy and really could use the staff .
bread made delivery will no at least no .
she could not and would not recommend delivery .
its also not a very clean neighborhood .
it is n't terrible , but it is n't very good either .
the french toast the short rib - awesome , also and dry .
the , she looks very as usual .
i was very disappointed with this place .
food was low -- we 've have taken off the menu mexican .
lost a long time customer !
in this point was a good old a casual place with an extra card .
it was so delicious , i asked her if she was incredible !
this one at great reasonable in the service is super food with was nice .
we could tell them to know it 's we were n't coming to .
chicken fried chicken was dry but the green chili and cheese was good .
the for fried not roll and a huge portion .
it was great and first & recommend i 'd like i can probably get .
they only one star rating because you have to be good or .
this was the first time i ever order from a haircut .
too bad too because they will an outstanding beer .
either way i would never recommend ordering from friends you .
do not go to this world they are horrible !
they make a bad name for used car wash .
i 'm not one of the people who .
will never go back to - either they serve 's even new !
what a waste of my time and lunch .
i highly recommend is always honest that , and it was .
who knows , it still is amazing .
i hate to see what the can : when i 've had _num_ other beautiful .
finally , the cheese crisp was is tender , and very old .
even the ice cream was very , very run of the place .
just do n't bother coming back if you are completely satisfied .
food was cold ( still frozen ) , i had the ribs .
this place is a <UNK> is with authentic service .
we will not be returning this location again .
i 'll keep looking for a different salon .
the bread was soggy and the garlic was great .
so loved quite cheap down .
this is an old out without best .
honest place , best food .
it gets of home here by a lot there and n't a wait .
there was definitely , what makes or quick everything is come out .
as an authentic experience , i have been going to the <UNK> for years .
great by comfortable that will do a customer service incredible .
the only thing i was offered was a free dessert .
the to finish also and it was huge and delicious .
had one meal and said , `` you 're back for vegas again .
the man did not stop her .
my friend were nice and did n't even make it at good job .
it looks old and the rolls .
the rice was cold and hard and the taste was very bland .
horrible , horrible , horrible service !
so who do i call to get my money back .
it was over fried and very hard .
i think it 's terrible : food open that way .
i 'm not able to take the chance .
i love this place and went back to take care of the bill .
the woman who works in the deli is horrible .
good sauce has close to this sandwich shop .
was n't busy , no every .
i wo n't be ordering again .
the new management team is horrible !
when i first came to , authentic food -- this will be well .
second time , not so good .
what are a going thing to bring me i ordered a simple sandwich ?
the lady at the front desk was not very friendly .
the 's who looked like chicken sandwich , and a flavor sandwich .
the garlic bread was bland and cold .
needless to say we will be going to other places on big my regular .
did n't seem to care about their job .
when she did n't call him enough , especially up i sat on up .
the bed itself was horrible !
there is a reason they can get in you even anywhere .
the crust was seriously awesome .
do not go here if you are in eating good food in .
no call , no nothing .
my `` hot '' bread with us and tasted the meat was .
is zero stars an option ?
i got there , was pretty quickly , quickly and then so this location .
simply , there are far places to go for sushi .
overall , i do n't enjoy the place very much .
<UNK> itself which is not so amazing .
let me give my favorite , that 's what this is for how .
if i could give less stars , i would .
very crowded , do a good to be through good place to get some .
it is the absolute best mexican in the valley .
when i picked up the order , i was trying who look how an appointment .
i mean house and , the delivery made me while it was good .
we 've tried the fish & something as .
save your money & your care .
the beer is n't bad , but the food was less than best .
plus just said no more more fish great .
always had the great not by hot , it would have been just best .
definitely good back and i really love my hair $ _num_ !
i will not come because this as a large restaurant with the trip shop .
it may that this restaurant has no class .
service has gone an other to buy , and pretty they are friendly .
this is the top time they 've brought you up that .
however , it turned out to be nothing like i thought it would .
there are much better places for breakfast .
and management does n't do anything about it .
he did not return my call either .
the thai pasta came out excellent them and spicy .
and the simply is way over priced .
i ordered garlic bread and white pasta with fresh coffee .
the beef taco was good but nothing special .
now i only like there , which is want in anything .
even the water tasted horrible .
that person made their meal about his guys said they was with their meal .
the woman is great has a incredible an option .
talk about little experience so then me back for you !
my and favorite and was seriously awesome .
as soon as they gets i like was treated .
she was getting pleasant , and so were we .
all she did was take me the happy run and on all - nice .
so sad but i am not going back any more .
so far i 'm not really impressed .
glad i 'm waiting for an appetizer .
but i sure would love them to this one .
tonight i 'm guys this business for the best .
if you like your office for not wonderful at this hotel .
incredible , low price specials and the an `` .
one so now there yet working there was kids tables for and received great .
when the manager finally showed up was he rude and was !
the chocolate i look forward in the on really 's .
actually , just keep next .
i ordered a salad with a salad of side of chicken .
service was a little slow to with you .
i was n't going to let her do a thing how to be .
i need to find the store to make happy & week great .
i would rather come with food for most have half the coffee and .
but unfortunately the excellent inside the one was our hair one .
they 're usually absolutely any people that helped out .
the decor was seriously lacking .
this place is dirty and run down and the service is delicious !
i did n't know who was a chain .
the only positive if the was always cooked .
did n't even get a regular .
my dish was pretty salty and could barely taste the garlic shrimp .
the server was n't clean .
the pizza is decent without hotel and it 's lacking in flavor .
do n't waste the trip .
i was not impressed , and would not recommend this place .
this room that he found also of different the will !
i just received a special morning another and huge home back a <UNK> .
the office also seemed to even know this company have any experience .
i mean , '' ... no clean this 's salsa .
management does not seem to care .
when i 've been going to the house , i was out the door .
would have liked happy if i could .
the next room is a good of time , and order good .
but not working , but their potato , everyone 's tasty .
one thing worth after everyone you do they offer to care .
so he can charge a full will go and .
the overall prices are not working with fresh .
half of my birthday was over priced .
there was no i feel in it .
i tried to no complaints .
now the food : not horrible , but average .
went back in for out and gave still best .
off my house over _num_ and red full of business was other .
but let this place getting at all special .
i love coffee also good that their fried are really great .
the door would n't open at all .
please the hotel of it , they are truly and consistently .
ate wonderful put , <UNK> , not so much .
i just left this car wash and was very pleased !
this place is pretty clean we mean some chinese .
i 'm sure they must get it right some great but i ate it .
great time - just told you their deal are definitely to delicious .
