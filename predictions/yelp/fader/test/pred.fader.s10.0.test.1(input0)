i guess their pizza is very good atmosphere at all costs .
the shrimp we ordered over .
let me tell you , this place was from top notch !
i know why i could order the restaurant very flavorful .
i guess she was n't happy that we were they are the happy .
at this location the service was terrible .
very disappointed and would stay here of this place .
if i could give zero stars i would recommend .
has been know 's , it been tasty for some special last night .
what about the time i hate ?
she did a wonderful job that he 's a great had an oil change .
it 's just too expensive for what you get .
there are better happy hour and prices are very many people !
she does n't say anything and just are perfectly home .
also , the food is that there is n't even better than his so .
the crust did even is friendly .
they want to check both times i tried in a look .
the food was quality ; and their hours little flavor with little .
two of hours my food is never get my car .
management no longer about the green service was affordable .
just went back to get the they only were next door .
she just a couple of help he and from customers .
as for the food , never had it .
service was just as disappointing .
i was the hot and enjoy in all free and great happy .
but the customer service took their happy to me .
needless to say , i know the manager while where i enjoy her .
no impressed with my or another sandwich .
i had to leave a , and they never , even my sandwich .
you wo n't find a better atmosphere in charlotte .
needless to say i will not be back for mexican food .
overall it was a pleasant neighborhood .
the rooms of she came extremely clean and a decent selection .
crab tacos , no , nothing other flavor .
that is good a good neighborhood or a great thing ?
seriously , though i have never been here .
the salon is very yummy was hot and i ordered a bit of far .
the neighborhood area is nothing special .
even if i was just and i could have someone i love this pizza .
maybe they were having a great night ?
like it 's been in a week for a week .
the food is not that authentic .
do n't go here unless you want to pay for crap .
i did n't even eat it .
you are not the best place in town with pizza .
my son is only for the two times .
in my opinion , they did n't need me for nothing .
had to wait a month to get in .
then he takes me to find me really are happy .
this is the reason i will never go back .
always happy too long it is amazing if even a great one it .
i just love what made it 's best work right .
however , the overall wonderful bread to all about this .
i should have with their lunch without school .
yes , the portions were large , but is usually good .
i have to say i was extremely disappointed .
our waiter have several tables all and are great .
great manager a the atmosphere of a doctor .
the only thing that we ordered was hot is the coffee .
just left and took it off the bill .
the rooms are not that nice and the food is not that good either .
they tried real hard to get to do what i 'm fantastic for .
an , they serve at everyone else and still menu on the .
no stars is what in good to help .
i looked around and there were still customers .
we will not be coming back .
it did n't think of stuff is good and in high all good .
went into this location to find my burger .
the food is n't too bad but the service is terrible .
so , it went in the valley .
next dish was delicious to bring something which is the little a good ) .
now , our lunch got very you and will not to go here .
needless to say , i will not be returning to this place ever again .
they do not feel fresh and not their own pretty good .
if your car is well , prices is always packed for her .
there are super good ( and they 're really fast is .
when i arrived , no one was the at it .
so i brought my business elsewhere .
the second time has gone in also and had another really much ) .
i 'm in a neighborhood where i would highly recommend .
the there itself is also a very happy thing .
absolutely both enjoyed stay away from this place .
anything they say , well , much .
good job i have been it !
in fact that quick and authentic mexican and it actually here with the sandwich are definitely .
and the food is simply not as good as the other reviews .
his such a spot and one `` office '' had _num_ ) .
the beer sauce is consistently at best .
this is the best new location there is very good !
best customer service i have ever had .
my husband had to stop by to get the order but its been right .
the rest of their food is outstanding but amazing are quick and the best .
but their was beautiful and it !
not even real sauce .
no , the not fresh , decent and the place still in old .
just a delicious salad made a bit one of a home .
cheese thai was n't the best as well quality ever .
i will never use another new come again .
i 'd never have enough business even as many hours to have amazing reviews .
it does not take that long to live music !
he did n't even offer up a long time for that way .
chips and best sauce i 'm ok for that i .
had to say place almost pretty nice and delicious .
it was my last year half my wife .
we both found it felt nice and very tasty .
there was only meat and bread .
the only thing was so easy to the burger was amazing enough !
we were her wife or something ?
the food was pretty good , i would definitely go there again .
this place is just ok .
i 've never had a worse experience than this !
i do not recommend anyone to this starbucks .
if i was the manager , i 'd highly recommend them on the off .
the problem is nothing was good .
since my food is right and a local place for good local a year .
however , this experience went pretty fast .
you can not get quality hair on special .
it is not really amazing rice .
we said enjoyed are a little of food and we love the italian menu .
not so much these days .
the place is small , i 'm sure she could have it out .
not coming or meat is fresh .
service fair , was great - special than my order - consistently .
the sandwich was not that great .
the food was mediocre at best , i even made tacos and well not taste .
i have not received such an excellent job in the neighborhood .
i went to down and wait for dinner my order .
this place is a terrible place to live !
just good and is can say i can .
we will spend our money elsewhere .
we found something and we got some really excellent and service was excellent .
i love the food ... best service here is perfect .
but this place was not so fresh and it had no location .
when it came out they have done it back .
so , that was my one time and asked the wine list there .
no longer and their food is phenomenal .
if i had zero of it would have i 'll it myself !
the place is so old and very authentic .
new owner , i ca n't say but they always love the place .
these days the quality is pretty good .
i was one for a done , and i found my 's for years .
dr. 's very good and did the best garlic .
the wine was very reasonable and the service was even better .
small time going down is the best .
the do i 've ordered several and take my dog but our home came off .
too bad it was at the other the customers of other .
so , no very good and help me came with my friends to help .
`` no , we are going to have a new home .
i was so i could say not happy in the rest of the day .
found the place there is most sweet it to be nice and comfortable .
, my favorite fast to have amazing breakfast to eat at this place .
the service is mediocre and the restaurant is just average .
and for this reason , i wo n't return .
i will never visit the salon again .
huge special tasted pretty good or you do , just have n't worth it .
i guess great even have great more food .
i love a good course without the quality of on yelp .
but it was simply and hot in there .
so i ordered my burrito , new hot , an old airport out home .
did n't feel like with their to say you feel welcome .
this is the best neighborhood gem of them so of a few .
i did n't know there can get from these like happy .
we went there on a busy weekend and the service was extremely friendly .
also , they could not have a perfect cheese sandwich with good beer ( did !
i went to pho because it 's employees delicious but highly .
we did n't order with anything that day .
we gave it another amazing he made us so them and left .
this is getting worse and everyone around .
unfortunately , the new rolls are not good .
zero stars with his work .
it looks like they look into their salad with delicious the dressing dressing .
do not recommend the job with these people .
this was by far the best person i with her .
this place is beyond a true deal .
i said it was absolutely the best salon to this salon .
i also so much better from this they have dining .
dr. most good , and they one is the only good in the order .
this one is not on the top .
took my car to get a quick and put a new out salad .
it tasted like everyone and had perfect and the he always looked .
this place has me off ... the perfect time .
i 'm still my favorite it on town !
it 's not my favorite , but it 's not awful .
also enjoyed is cooked , i could not enjoyed .
i thought a few years and it 's a great restaurant .
but it actually not be amazing in las vegas .
we then our order with our server and completely extremely helpful and pleasant things .
i do not like the kind of the their dining .
dr. business is still amazing great all the inside looking .
when it came out quickly , it was great .
probably about _num_ % i had that the pizza made an salad delicious .
the service was so now slow .
i tried to order and we 're still friendly .
this spot was my favorite restaurant .
stopped by for lunch after being at the next shop next door .
, i do n't take care my questions or any did .
this time of being open me so cool , for the airport .
oh well , who ... right me ?
went to the sunday brunch to our table 's almost visit you .
it did n't get anywhere .
the food 's quality , and the service is definitely this place in the area .
is also almost as bad as usual on sunday .
service was average but definitely could not make for the drink food and wonderful .
but was very disappointed with what actually arrived .
i was also just ate great little waitress but he truly great deal .
horrible job on and nails are .
highly recommend this , the same other does they get us delicious !
always happy in the salon , so have been a pleasant business !
my wife ordered the chicken a beef sandwich ( the breakfast and the cheese dressing .
she said she 'd be back and for a few minutes .
my wife ordered `` two pizza for a special like cheese but of high quality .
the sauce was nice and it too .
in my opinion will say the salon was over and the all over the help .
the sales people here are good .
the food was pretty good all ... and looked never .
but it probably sucks too !
no , i 'm not a good at pittsburgh .
they wo n't you though .
it 's always busy and the food is very dirty .
absolutely , best italian service to check this place .
it 's like not much an amazing sauce , still is a favorite joint .
i brought those special that they actually big with drink rice .
, their wings are what they 're other places than .
the salads are ok , nothing special .
they did not have a fresh when fresh on ?
this is a horrible neighborhood .
i always know it is all very friendly and taste delicious good than this place .
they can thank you for the low care .
i wish i could give less than one star .
the beer was nice and delicious !
he could n't actually her drinks with me coffee .
i would never recommend anyone to live here .
french toast was good , always beef and homemade , delicious dishes .
i called at least and got the right spot in town .
my wife and a local gem had quality of the best .
i know i should have found this company , well worth .
, dr. , but on an , must .
love at quality as well .
you can not pay me to see here ever !
there are no sushi and no customer service .
they love my work done , so quick , a great experience .
this is a terrible airport .
we 'll see if that is perfect , but i definitely not my friends .
she said `` sorry , '' .
first finally is always chili got me - i get any and order .
great service in these ... got at our really visit .
they also have delicious sushi that good food , sushi selection .
this is a great this location without new hard in pittsburgh .
other than that , i really know what to everyone but i just wanted .
and the pizza was cold , greasy , and quite awful .
salsa is also very good or .
owner on my very friendly servers .
stay away , and go to clean store .
i would n't go back there again .
we 've been to this long time something especially everyone .
nice next time on being good .
i 'm from the area i moved and was to $ _num_ over .
the staff was prompt to be found .
however , everyone else so far my favorite pasta .
not so great food and service .
so disappointing from an old favorite .
absolutely great but nothing special .
, yes it , i do n't need its always star .
, way way too .
we get off with _num_ people , we got so this .
i asked for two or quality and very little pleased .
my friends for not been back especially i have spent .
you 'll have zero stars after the first bite .
i mean that 's been my experience !
an old school of my got .
sushi , you are so reasonable is to me .
the green man looks solid .
i had a horrible experience , and i would not come back .
i always love a great way to find , or almost ok .
the food here is bland and sweet and great .
really fun pizza was extremely nice !
the fried rice was great and a wait was the man always enjoyed .
the store is looking and new management are nice at done .
no amazing are highly recommended how are your down the steak .
i just walked out , the waitress itself to the valley .
they really need to work on their customer service and clean .
so you are i fresh , too .
i recommend to like this place but it just a big disappointment .
they have to top it room in part of the that part .
plus the overall it is also as amazing as it is our dinner .
she was not happy being there .
my wife came in for lunch and was still take home .
first , the bartender was a nice an open .
i ca n't believe how this gem is really good .
unfortunately , it is the best .
its our server asked her clean with our drink so tasty just fun .
oh , i should not have asked .
i was very impressed and the night .
what the hell are you love ?
however , the manager came out & he gave me to my wife ordered .
it is also quite expensive for my taste .
for the price we ordered a good , i love their meal !
it is way overpriced ( to what they 're doing !
one of the employees , but it did n't seem very nice .
i left and highly recommend and do my order .
the burgers were over cooked and the meat that was our servers .
great food but horrible staff and very very friendly environment !
they said , get me and does n't love their customers .
three weeks for breakfast here again and look great at helpful .
this is the best mexican food and they 've had in my life .
bottom line they made right and comfortable staff .
i 've eaten here many times but , as bad ... so good .
the a salad was great .
so i asked for the to be back .
other than that , food here is pretty high .
they tried to take me of because i 'm extremely good .
the green chili were ok but not great .
the beans were in the world in the rice was able to be found .
their cheese i 'm comfortable , was the high variety .
the place has gone downhill especially over the years .
nothing that special about this place .
i also told him i would never love some good chinese dishes .
when i was finally there , i was very disappointed .
she did not or anything else .
prices are just plain perfectly .
it was top and delicious to put me .
not sure and i do n't care !
it was so good i not just be going that when we paid .
this was my first visit for in there for a family .
we asked our money to be honest , she would was their regular .
i 'm not a fan of huge restaurants restaurants .
if i was n't with my food , she would be back .
the food is worse than you in the right area at all especially .
i make it back but a love this bar with the best pizza .
sauce had been way too much in it .
this location is pretty nice and its never love the food .
bread should be nice and breakfast feel .
she could n't a great job was also amazing .
its also a very good clean guy .
it is good but , but it is n't very good either .
the one ordered the ice cream , almost chicken and always dry .
the bartenders are very knowledgable as usual .
i was very disappointed with this place .
food was literally now they 'll be one at its great service .
lost a long time customer !
best ) in the valley was a big fan and was out looking for everyone .
it was so professional with that she 's amazing & he was great !
this is definitely in the best place in the salon with that little too .
we tried it 's a hard time to do n't work to time .
chicken fried chicken was the dry but perfect cheese and was tasty but off .
the we 're drink and was a huge fan .
it was all for those , so they do a pizza you just so .
they only one star because my family have to have a restaurant .
this was the first time i ever received from a office .
too bad because you did pretty much beer excellent .
either way i would recommend him from start twice tonight .
do not go to this point they are the amazing !
they make a great selection for car wash used .
i 'm not one of the best people .
will never go back to - they favorite thai service me up !
what a waste of my time and money .
i want to best service , always on time to you .
who knows , it have been nice .
i hate to see what their delivery times are when it 's _num_ hours .
finally , the cheese was cool and flavorful but it was perfect .
even the ice cream was very , very affordable a is great .
just do n't order before you 're being great .
food was delicious ( fresh ) , i had the ribs .
this place is a true deal with work service .
we will not be visiting this location again .
i 'll keep looking for a different salon .
the bread was soggy and the crust was phenomenal .
so tasted old my nails .
this is an old school lunch also .
place , best chinese food .
it 's off because at a night we was a wait and happy .
there was i am without sure how she came with everything just .
as an appetizer , i have been going to the place for years .
by far that wonderful friendly as does i work excellent .
the only thing i was enjoyed a was free dessert .
the front desk is very clean and had been warm .
had one meal and owners , we try and again should be honest .
the man did not stop her .
my hair were very honest and did n't even do a good job .
it looks old and _num_ .
the rice was cold and hard and the taste was very delicious .
horrible , horrible , horrible service !
so who do i go to my friend back .
it was over priced and very hard .
i think it 's simple bar since that amazing work .
i 'm not going to take the all .
i found the salon and back make to take care of the bill .
the lady who works in the is extremely good .
good absolutely _num_ ... loved to see but now .
was n't busy , no .
i wo n't be ordering again .
the new management is extremely the !
when i order from , no this new just are right to help .
second time , not so good .
what were you to make for cheese he can recommend the again ?
the lady at the front desk was not very friendly .
the 's looked very old , they are tasty and nice were excellent .
the bread salsa was bland and delicious .
to make sure we will be going to other than coming from now on .
did n't seem to care about their job .
when she did n't help us love his feel , he up on her .
the front desk was horrible !
there is a wonderful thing i even get in madison .
the staff was seriously excellent ... .
always do the food here is nice for the food breakfast in town .
no call , no nothing .
my `` hot '' salad and they are over was the wait .
is zero stars an option ?
i was always the owner and no one stop , then my next door .
have been , the before best places to go for sushi .
overall , i do n't enjoy the place very much .
<UNK> green tea is always great though .
let me tell my what , i 's that local to this location .
if i could give less stars , i would .
very good , something to have a well to have such good a time .
it is the absolute worse place in the valley .
when i ended up , the first was this store never perfect price .
i called , and made the know why our order was great .
we 've tried the ice cream as well .
save your money & your did .
the beer is n't bad , but the food was less than impressed .
keep ) they are so unique quality sandwiches .
had it been so great , its never had you have just been it .
definitely sure i had that my hair even my fries !
i will not keep this company to the people on time to look great .
it seems that this restaurant has no stars .
`` best '' my business to see at their & a nice pizza .
this is the time they 've keep up it is delicious .
however , it 's always like that will be nothing it 's great .
there are much better places for breakfast .
and management does n't do anything about it .
he did not return my order either .
the thai chicken sandwich came out quickly and spicy .
and the decor , best in cut .
i ordered garlic bread and everything also over with pasta .
the beef taco was good but nothing special .
only now i 'm really surprised , and really liked me .
even the water tasted horrible .
that person working get best when they leave help in order with their meal .
the there selection is no free what we have .
talk about an absolute neighborhood before you guys go there !
my boyfriend and pizza was also warm .
as soon as they because i have a tasted like .
she was getting surprised , and so we were .
she all was really happy me and the store and these excellent and time .
so fast good with the best place just back here .
so far i 'm not really impressed .
i 'm waiting for an i 'm .
but i sure could have done other one .
tonight i all use this for company .
if you ever need a do we use this hotel at this .
good job , price specials are the perfect you .
so one person had everything else was old and then waiting to get .
when the manager finally he up was amazing and nice !
the waitress is amazing in the kitchen is very comfortable .
actually , just keep perfectly .
i ordered a salad with a side of chicken too .
service was a little slow to say with .
i was n't going to her its cool to some me to leave .
i need to find a favorite for a cool little guys for these .
i would rather wait for hot food which are definitely friendly and the food .
but unfortunately the inside the time i ordered out very well .
they 're doing any place right that came out .
the decor was seriously lacking .
this place is dirty and run down and the service department !
i did n't know how a side was .
the only thing went but the soup was delicious .
did n't even get a smile .
my dish was pretty sweet and well worth how not the old .
the server was n't great .
the pizza is just next door and it 's in flavor .
do n't waste the trip .
i was not impressed , and would not recommend this place .
this room that he had me in thai of order !
i just received a order from them because service and will definitely return .
the office also to even see to eat their special experience great .
i , these , tasted so ... i 'll definitely .
management does not seem to care .
when i 'm in a good price , when i got out the door .
would have gotten better but that could .
the room is a fun of time , and best me .
but not comes , the best bread was their ... yummy .
one thing another great night did n't do this place .
so they can find a large right for them .
the menu is definitely well , with no .
half of my favorite was over priced .
there was no wait to our server .
i tried to no taste .
now the food : great , the beef and atmosphere .
went back in for years , which highly recommend .
off my husband ordered and many great drink on people not .
but this place kept over and professional staff .
i love everything pretty much salsa but their super are really great .
the view will n't order at all .
little thing i were fresh , extremely polite and lots .
ate dr. <UNK> , but always worth that much .
i just left this car wash and was very pleased !
this place like old school bar for some reason .
i 'm sure they get it fresh right and tasted definitely good this week .
... we just tried him that we really love to be good .
