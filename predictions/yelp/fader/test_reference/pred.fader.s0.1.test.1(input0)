ever since 've found welcome maybe it 's just definitely worse and worse .
there is definitely not enough room in that part of the venue .
she said she 'd be back and especially for a few minutes .
so trust tasted like thanks .
i ca n't believe how bad this facility is .
just left and took it off the bill .
it is n't terrible , but it is n't very good either .
definitely disappointed that i could not use my birthday birthday !
new owner , i early there but i do n't know the best .
but it probably sucks too !
we sit down and we got some really slow and prompt service .
the manager did not beef soup and a small salad .
said we could n't sit at the table if we were n't order dinner .
there was no i 'm sorry or what they come came home .
the curry area area was empty and no one was delivered the front store .
there were incredibly , but the employees which is really bland .
the wine was very average and the food was even less .
good items by far that do n't understand customer service .
the burgers were over cooked to the point the meat was in probably .
a cheese dining then was the best one by any .
my favorite thai tasted like thai rice noodles with noodles sauce .
she said `` yes , sorry . ''
the store is way looking and management needs to change .
there was only meat and bread .
when i counter in a few lunch i was dirty to fresh the services .
she was not happy being there .
phoenix past the future , they were dry and beans excellent .
the `` beautiful is no longer an option .
anyway , we got our coffee and will not return to this location .
the decor was really lacking .
the sales people here are terrible .
salsa is not hot or good .
i just received a delivery order from them and almost wasted my money .
so i asked for the street to be delicious .
all she did would give me the run around and but took the italian .
i was n't going to let her do a thing taking to me .
the beans were in the find in the rice was crisp to be found .
they tried to take care of me because i am vibe .
we 've enough sent enough no have valley really absolutely with this restaurant .
always rude in their and always have always during customer service !
they really need to work on their customer service and attitude attitude .
i eating eating and we went back to the beer .
when i first came to look ... this yes not spicy to me .
my `` hot '' sauce was cold and the meat was wash .
i asked for thai hot and received very little cozy .
you wo n't find a better selection in scottsdale .
i left hungry and waitresses , never again .
i was very sick the night after .
had one mediocre meal and said , we 'll try again '' again .
i just left this car wash and was very best !
the food 's ok , the service is also my wife i have absolutely .
this was my first stop in or a next place three .
then he seemed to get her how to treat it .
do not go to this combo they are horrible !
i guess she was n't happy that we were sick the prices .
the only great egg was the workers beans .
other than that , food here is pretty gross .
lost a long time customer !
i was also about having going - service every <UNK> off off .
so far i 'm not really impressed .
our is definitely excellent my business to this & , nice & easy .
my daughter is only for the two stars .
the food was pretty bad , i would not go there again .
we will not be using this location again .
you 'll have zero if no stay the other .
this is a horrible venue .
do n't go here unless you want to pay for crap .
but it may not actually be in charlotte anyway .
this place is a terrible place to live !
owner : a very rude man .
stopped by for after being after at the but coming next service ever .
my dish was pretty cool and could barely taste the extra garlic .
it looks like be cut their got into the front of the bartenders burrito .
what about the time i wasted ?
the rooms are not that nice and the food is not that good either .
there are better happy hours and better beers all around town !
great egg would walk by not even make good morning .
this spot was my favorite ribs restaurant .
i will not say how best in it with who of pittsburgh to help .
not even real crispy sauce .
his guys of a `` free dessert '' was even more pretty .
but was very disappointed with what actually arrived .
i was so employee i could not way for the rest of the day .
the salads are ok , nothing special .
overall it was a great evening .
the fix did n't even fantastic .
i expected not to be slow that morning , and it was .
zero short with his work .
the garlic bread was bland and cold .
the this was way too hot .
i know i should have customers this back and walk out .
they wo n't tell you though .
i love the food ... however service here is horrible .
<UNK> itself however is not so amazing .
needless to say i will not be back for mexican food .
i wo n't be ordering again .
let me give my `` place , that 's how this store is .
she did not our or anything .
but this place was not so good did the best different .
prices are just plain comes .
it offer and tasted like if 's oil .
who knows , it might have been .
the beer sauce is cafe at best .
the building itself looks cake .
i 've never had a worse experience than this !
we 've tried the changed pancakes as well .
no , i 'm not at a your store .
if i could give zero stars i ( it .
only now i 'm really hungry , and really makes off .
no call , no nothing .
i wish i could give less than one star .
the touch was everything never filling .
if i could give less stars , i would .
she could not and would not be finally .
think twice -- this place is a az .
i 'm not one of the half people .
even if i was able , never i did n't this pizza in specials .
it 's always busy and the restaurant is very dirty .
as an arizona recently , i have been going to the <UNK> for years .
i got there , was pretty hot dr. and while i tried from my husband .
so , no there and no time to help me deal with my friend .
at this location the service was terrible .
overcooked so foods that it was the cooked of give fish chicken .
so who do i call to get my money back .
i 'm employee in a otherwise that would i remember .
service was a little slow to write with .
`` did n't enjoyed our show up with another great egg '' of water .
the food was prompt and very over priced for what you get .
i hate to see what their delivery times are when it 's last call .
just went back to get the back chocolate interesting and nicely .
i had to leave a visited , and they never called me back .
i expected so much better from this strong ... .
the food is worse than you find in the auto from itself at .
they tried real hard to get me to come back but i refused .
the this walked comes people and felt on our employees brought our open me .
i wanted to like this place but it just gave a big disappointment .
i did n't know how there can get love from customer .
and the cleaning is way over priced .
when i was finally there , i was very disappointed .
they make a bad name for used car car .
so sad but i am not going back any more .
just a frozen cooked like cooked in no one .
this is the worst neighborhood tea if out any of them of .
the new management team is horrible !
they also have lost all of what good italian food is .
just do n't bother ordering anything if you 're seated .
i ! , '' '' ... no i 'm cool .
the evening started out slow .
vibe i 'm waiting for an answer .
the bed bed was horrible !
my community found a best gyro under one of the rest .
oh , i should not have asked .
i have to say i was quality disappointed .
this place is just ok .
yeah , there is no sausage or bacon on the menu .
this is the reason i will never go back .
the office also expect to even how about this whole experience department .
when the manager finally tomato up he was rude and , !
there are no longer and no customer service .
kind , way way worse .
when she did n't bother him quickly enough , he makes my order on .
the fried rice was gross and there was a also of having it .
if your patio is return , an , so of out because .
plus the could did n't even know how to work the fast .
overall : lost my business and line for a good local place tea .
it was so foods , i asked her if she was ?
the food was mediocre at best , far too greasy and not cooked well .
food was cold ( still frozen ) , i had the ribs .
was n't busy , no atmosphere .
the bathroom area is nothing special .
also , the food that is there is n't great even by buffet buffet .
this room that he found also salt of the go !
a wine : no more comes like parking .
so i brought my business elsewhere .
it 's part on a saturday night there was n't a long wait .
so disappointing from an old favorite .
the folks of the meat like also and wrong tasted .
a airport sauce in way too much in it .
they only received one star because you have to share a rating .
i will never visit the salon again .
this was by far the absolute worst i made with .
i would n't go back there again .
the rest of their food is thin but their employees and service are horrible .
as for the food , never had it .
i 'm from the area and burrito was this for a very busy priced .
however , the could said nothing to me about this .
my mom ordered the airport chicken experienced beef and i ordered the best beef .
i ordered garlic bread and !
it does not take that long to cook cook !
the sandwich was not that great .
wonderful ... we just told him that we did n't want to the neighborhood .
the man did not stop her .
tasted really old , i could n't believe it .
it is also perfect unique for my taste .
food was delivered maybe we should have ordered off the mexican menu .
but want not bad , their az there was ... greasy .
one myself thing after another they do n't care to good .
it 's good that restaurant has no class .
my plate looked waiting two italian be a bar for the high of should be .
we 've been to this long special great or dinner .
we gave it another come minutes before we got up and left .
when i arrived , no one was at the desk .
seating 's has been served to be cheap with their drink burrito for years .
even the ice cream was very , very run of the strip .
the service is mediocre and the restaurant is just average .
as soon as they delivered i was like an : .
but i 'm sure could have cooked this one .
just terrible is all i can say .
did they not have a have funny on ?
his egg sandwiches like best rolls and are great .
we stayed there in specials , because we never asked this .
stay away , and go to korean instead .
i 've eaten here many times , but week as bad as last night .
always takes way too long even if you 're the only one there .
so , that was my one and only time ordering the there rate .
however , everyone else then with new their were very cream .
one of the employees they start , but it did n't very cute .
overall , i do n't enjoy the place very much .
there is a reason they can get you in fairly quickly .
is zero stars an option ?
in the long run , they did absolutely nothing for me .
but let this started steak too and home .
it is the absolute worse place in the valley .
seriously though , i have never def here .
chicken fried chicken was dry but the green chili hand and cheese was good .
but their the or was !
so he can charge a could portion for them .
were we really thanks or something ?
this place has become me off for the last time .
do not sign a love with these people .
had to returned one since for like cold .
do n't waste the trip .
i mean that 's been my experience !
the there was a mess .
either way i would never recommend him with far man .
the beef taco was good but nothing special .
i went to sit down and wait for my order .
its also not a very clean park .
they charged me for work not done , and am not one .
i tried to call '' with no curry .
he did not return my call either .
it looks old and again .
i would perfect for hot food quality is like it were very pleasant .
if you its a family do not stay at this hotel .
the food here is bland and boring and bad .
this one is not on the weekends .
for the best i am a good cook , i use this glad !
the i dining is not an issue either .
very crowded , used to have a chance to actually have a good time .
i think it 's terrible when employees eating that way .
you can not pay me to ever shop here !
i 'll keep looking for a different salon .
french friend was fantastic , there goes , said but eggs were cold .
now the food : not horrible , but waiting average .
this is dogs the worst haircut food i 've had in my life .
no stars is what in want to give .
when it came we should have liked it back .
the pricey is so old and looks dirty .
this place is order way off for some reason .
i 'm not paying to take the chance .
i dont know why i was feeling anything different .
thanks line they over priced and under weekend .
nothing that special about this place .
<UNK> 's casual on every quiet .
pay then price from but , i was the only one is the favorite .
management no longer about the prime one was .
found the place even though it is hard to `` the price ) .
the such itself was very book and had weird great .
two hours of my life i can never get back .
not sure and i do n't care !
she off my red loved and three toast of so large .
very disappointed and would stay music of this place .
service fair , probably was good ( absolutely happy ... long i .
second time , not so good .
he did n't even offer another time for me to come in .
the bread was soggy and the massage was also .
the lady at the front desk was not very friendly .
what the services are you doing ?
i was not impressed , and would not recommend this place .
the making sauce was too sweet too .
i checked with the burger and the worst classic got this was good .
finally , the cheese crisp was crisp and was anything but homemade .
parking : it no or anything , so you just if it to .
fabulous , the help , on lady .
i should have stayed with special chinese dining .
not so great food and service .
the pizza is offered without up and it 's lacking in flavor .
this is an old '' on experience .
the i always music to looked food .
this place is beyond a flat waste .
however , it meat out to be like nothing i thought it would .
this place is a nicely hole with also customer service .
went back in for back , makes no was surprised .
service was just as disappointing .
the only thing i was just clean , an dessert .
i do not recommend anyone to this starbucks .
i had a horrible experience , and i gave it 's come back .
management does not seem to care .
it is not really awesome rice .
did n't even get a curry .
needless to say , i 'm the store manager call if my amount .
my wife came in for all was and quite best quite .
had it been not so hot dog , it would have just been fresh .
i ordered a pleasant salad with a side of they cheese .
she did offer me a parking if i would like a friend & dogs .
i 'm to let them know but they will care care .
i 've very cool how fresh their one really are .
it did n't get finished .
he could n't actually clearly her , healthy , though .
we will not be coming back .
absolutely terrible , do not order from this place .
ate else made , <UNK> , not so much .
and the food is simply not as good as the other locations .
even the water tasted horrible .
but it was disgusting and hot in there .
thanks good does n't it ?
yes , the portions were large , but size is n't everything .
it was over fried and very hard .
i have not received such an attitude much a customer before .
the overall prices are not worth with staff .
we 'll see if that probably , but i 'm not worth my nails .
too bad it was at the the own of your fish .
no my wife started and person up all around the valley .
and management does n't do anything about it .
what were you going to charge me when i loved a wife two ?
i 'm still trying my absolute noodles !
this fix should not be in the service here being in job that job .
these days the quality is pretty can .
service was average but could not make up for the poor food and drink .
my husband had to walk up to the bar to place our meal order .
and the pizza was cold , greasy , and crazy quite awful .
maybe they were having a bad night ?
this place is dirty and run down and the service perfect !
the only thing we received that was hot was the coffee .
it was party for all food , though i do n't think he also .
so , it went in the trash .
so i ordered my son eggs , told an appointment for two days out .
otherwise , i do n't take any bed bed with me .
the beer is n't bad , but the food was less than , usually .
when it finally came out , it was bad .
the food is n't too bad but the service is terrible .
talk about the new so call before you go !
but the customer service meh it all for me .
crab , prime , extremely i other flavor .
i just walked out , called the manager to say .
i was very disappointed with this place .
unfortunately , the second are tasty is very if .
so you are n't my problem . ''
everything i need to find a great or those for those tasted awesome .
she does n't say anything and just see us .
the others ordered the meals smell friendly , also warm and dry .
the staff was able to be found .
it did n't matter of she is good at all other times .
it tasted like best or had was good and quite clearly .
i bought this and he went back to take care of the bill .
save your money & your selection .
one was for my dog , and the last time because my neighborhood dog .
what a waste of my time and and found .
my favorites for not looking more worth , i guess .
the server was n't buying .
sad what has happened to this sandwich shop .
worst customer service i have ever had .
and for this reason , i wo n't return .
this is getting has worse and worse .
they makes to come us eating in the bar was an option .
they can thank you for the low rating .
this was the first time i ever cuisine from a haircut .
i did n't even eat it .
if i was n't with my mention , i would 've walked out .
there was no longer to our server .
i 'm sure they must get it right some days but not this day .
i did n't know how was a chain .
went to the sunday brunch to our daughter took 's your crispy .
this is the second time they 've always worth that loves .
the theater room is a waste of time , and parking customer .
i also told him i would leave him some good online online .
however , the manager came back & told me my order was coming up .
is that a good thing or a bad thing ?
it was so much not good that i just wanted out of there .
during the manager is a horrible person .
we told them to will no , we did you should to wait .
first , the bartender was an a lot star .
i guess even great restaurants have bad days .
absolutely ridiculous stay away from this place .
oh well , who also ... right ?
we will spend our money elsewhere .
great french and hand little weeks i paid for that .
i will never purchase another nice said again .
we did n't leave with anything that day .
horrible , horrible , horrible service !
now it is not so cool and taste like any pizza places place .
this part of just asked me even watch for my soup .
the rice was cold and hard and the taste was very bland .
i 'm not a fan of huge stop restaurants .
you are not the only place in town with decent pizza .
you can not look people but on both .
the thai homemade pasta came out worth and spicy .
no great and their food is wow .
i would never think anyone to live here .
had to wait a month to get in .
great food but horrible staff and very very rude workers !
it was my last weekend loves my folks .
next dish was had green : made is happy which the is the sauce .
do not go here if you are in who good food eating .
prime sub was there , but very forever clearly .
tonight i lost all about for this company .
honestly to say we will be going to other places that thanks on now .
i may make it back to the bar but i will say the restaurant .
it 's not much like an has tasty dive but is made is .
let me tell you , this place was far from busy !
stayed this in price was a extra kept tea and no 's an extra experience .
the birthday found has been brunch as well as her special day .
other than that , i really do n't know what was good about it .
the only anyone was able to eat was the arizona beef beef !
the food is not that authentic .
actually , just keep such .
the place has obviously gone downhill over the years .
unfortunately , it is the worst .
did n't feel like with this coffee and restaurants to surprised .
not so much these days .
this is the worst & veggies location there is !
the door would n't open at all .
my '' were very clean and she did n't even do a good job .
the this front greeted in the good rooms is very loud .
we then we found our order with our extremely rude and could parking his return .
i may just right if the needs great things work .
it is way overpriced ( easy to what they serve !
this is a terrible crowd .
sadly , i will probably never be able to eat at this place again .
my was tasty and was really everything .
the this went 's like chicken chicken , and were also tasty .
i looked around and there were still customers .
i said it was disgusting to even serve this to everyone .
we both found it right for chicken and no .
in fact my always are authentic , into the noodles and all over the floor .
avoid if at all possible .
we asked how long the wait would be , she said she was loved .
i do not like to be able over , or short changed .
also , could they not bring you a helped of cheese or red egg ?
it 's just too expensive for what you get .
we went there on a busy lobster sunday and the service was extremely slow .
went into this location to grilled it off .
if i was the manager , i 'd offer that delicious on the spot .
too bad too because they 're an outstanding beer .
the food was low quality and there comes quickly with little flavor .
the beer was nice and cold !
will never go back to - they go they might from me !
the fix who works in the deli is horrible .
the to card waitress was a huge disappointment .
there are much better places for breakfast .
it 's not my amazing , but it 's not awful .
consistent , great and just a does need to just fried .
needless to say , i will not be returning to this place ever again .
each place , worst food .
consistent , their are garlic are sorry than other places .
anything they say , ask in animals .
but unfortunately the rude tip was the one red us out .
this is a far far for any new mexican white .
there selection in kitchen is plenty with spring oil with not are kept up .
bad service in these as return was fantastic our visit .
if i had wanted it would i have would have the pedicure myself !
she just has a couple empty dishes and walked off .
incredible , low price specials and the this old .
the green sports were ok but not great .
the problem is nothing was good .
i tried to no good .
there is also almost as bad as well sat on .
horrible job on nails and food .
i refused to purchase any of the not asian on quality .
the helped should be offered at no charge .
took my car to get well and one a homemade put on it .
simply , there are far from best to go for sushi .
that person 's tasty good everything work where everything 's well good meal .
seating see large pizza delivery !
the place is small , i 'm sure she could have it comes out .
they delivered , efficient and do n't pay attention to their customers .
no massage with my manicure or pedicure .
desert but nothing but special .
i called at least and got the complete him off .
however , this experience went pretty thank .
since their visit , the only we 've seen we were dining !
they 're near about any problems that have over .
she was getting surprised , and so were we .
did n't seem to care about their job .
would have have big you could i could .
not on healthy or the flavor .
so one never person while myself else was new and was waiting for delicious .
i do not like the size of the beautiful floor .
this location is super busy and still use a big the staff .
i guess starbucks at want is only good at some positive .
no , it is the right place , the end in little truly .
their cheese i 'm table and the selection of love .
three three repair for lunch last friday at <UNK> at a bbq .
sushi sushi , you are so employee to me .
half of my daughter was over priced .
an old did not loved my pedicure .
`` no , we are going to have a a will beer .
like it 's been in a visited for a week .
when i picked up the order , i was given another parking each reasonable .
they do not have some of the most definitely was tasty .
