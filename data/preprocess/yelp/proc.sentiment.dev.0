so we changed it up and guess what pizza still sucks !
things were not right .
my son 's smothered steak was da bomb !
skip skip skip it .
by far the worst dining experience i 've ever had in my entire life .
i would normally give og a 3-4 .
bad service .
lots of shady people out and about .
this was a waste of time .
i was so stoked to find a place near me , with good reviews .
the owner wo n't return calls and the staff wo n't help .
i 'm usually a big fan of olive garden .
not a family friendly place at all .
under it 's current management it 's a complete ripoff .
very messy and unorganized ... not too many clothes or shoes to choose from .
none of the _num_ employees in the kitchen acknowledged me .
avoid coming to this ghetto target !
not cool .
i did n't have to give you a dime .
really disappointed with the service at this location .
only reason i gave a star was yelp forced me too
both waiters where rude and condescending .
but , the shrimp linguini totally blew .
while the pizza was decent , the wings were awesome .
that 's not my problem !
the chicken egg foo young was ok .
the chicken was dry and way overcooked .
horrible .
shame i ca n't give this place a lower review .
they did not bother saying anything until i asked if they were closed .
so i was a little disappointed at this point .
fried shrimp was over cooked .
nothing special .
they do n't take care of their comics .
to make matters worse , the place has all the atmosphere of a warehouse .
member services ... is slow !
man this place used to be great .
i was very disappointed .
well , taco bell is taco bell .
the exam was decent , but after that it was all downhill !
had n't been to this place in _num_ years .
the honey sesame chicken was cold .
i show up a few minutes late and still wait an additional 10-15 minutes .
too bad !
_num_ for the homeless .
worst truck wash i ever get .
do not use this company !
do not trust these people , and also rude .
normally a person will tip _num_ % - _num_ % of their bill .
nor will anyone else i know .
according to aaa , the wrong size filter was installed .
when you pay for your order her proceeds to walk away after your change .
i went back through the website with another reservation to verify ... yup .
the deli and prepared food area smells bad .
avoid this location .
i probably wo n't be back for another _num_ .
location is not really nice .
no way i could make it across town on a friday night .
called early this morning at 8am to schedule an appointment for an oil change .
does n't offer and soy sauce or anything else .
how absurd !
spoke to a person at their office and was told sorry !
spent money on crappy food and horrible service !
this would have been the second time the tried to double charge me .
not a great selection , but cheaper than sweet tomato .
this is the inventory that no one wanted .
if anything , she seemed annoyed that she had to correct the order .
not my chips .
unfortunately for the price of rent here the apartments are really dated .
entirely way too long .
but i am not sure about the frozen lunch meat you are offered .
horrible customer service today !
the fried rice was terrible .
it was a little rude and off putting .
also missing , fork , napkins , condiments and the traditional fortune cookie .
i will never come to this restaurant again .
employees were overly rude , inconsiderate and unprofessional .
we started asking questions and he was being very rude .
now this place sucks .
the manager was nice enough - no big deal .
that was the only good thing about this place .
she rings me up and hands me one cup .
needless to say , i would n't recommend this company to anyone ever !
or did you just quit caring ?
i 'm pissed because good customer service would have been .
they charged for unnecessary supplies for a very poor quality service .
she was too confused to answer my question .
it was rated two star on hotwire but that was a real stretch !
do n't give them your business .
this place was a disaster .
no green grass at all .
the toilet in the room did n't stop running .
not much of the egg was noticeable in either dish .
my husband purchased some of their house made hot sausage .
so done trying new nail places .
failure one was not checking the address or even bothering to take one .
save your money and do n't buy a warranty !
( to eat , not to love , but to eat ) .
finally , we were pressured to donate our relatives body to medical research .
the exam was decent , but after that it went downhill !
worst room i have ever stayed in in my entire life .
that is ridiculous !
so basically their guarantee is that there is no guarantee .
we 'll not go back .
food arrives , everything is normal , whatever .
no paper towels anywhere in gas fill up area .
disgusting .
horrible service and ethics !
assuming that they had it on file , i didnt even ask .
i paid the $ _num_ and have never been back .
the bathrooms were very clean and the booth we were in was comfortable .
this made us a little uncomfortable .
it was weird .
also , most of the machines are taken all the time .
i leave not even a block away everything comes back on once again .
tried complaining to corporate office and they turned me back to the manager .
fuck this place and their lack of white chicken and corn .
if you like these fake chinese buffets , then ignore this review .
needless to say we were shocked .
maintenance replaced the phone .
great customer service but food was bland .
it was n't good .
the service here sucks .
there were like _num_ or _num_ other tables in the whole place .
of course , i called management and they said they would security immediately .
very limited selection of everything .
she says no i 'm a lead or something of that sort .
she then blamed me !
everything was horrible .
she would drag on the words in a high <UNK> voice .
the pizza came more quickly than we had anticipated !
the noise level was quite ridiculous .
the menu has nothing healthy on it .
another incident that should n't have happened was in the bakery .
it 's just too weird .
they are so busy only _num_ people working the food counter .
we picked _num_ cities to stop in while driving .
not like they 're doing the work for free !
the people working seemed very confused making my sandwich .
had i reviewed it i would have given it a solid _num_ .
the bread wasnt too bad .
edit : hi rick , i appreciate your desire for a resolution .
she is also an canadian / <UNK> .
i did n't like his service at all .
to be honest the only thing that was good was the fountain drinks .
they were quite disgusting .
it looks like someone 's already eaten it ! ''
i could n't even eat part of my meal .
i said i only use apple .

this place is worse than a prison !

if i could rate a zero i would .
it took _num_ minutes for a table to open up .
i was very disappointed with my manicure .
you really ca n't go wrong with fried shrimp .
it seemed gross and chewy .
she immediately got an attitude and told me they was not cold .
( he was under a year old ) .
but , all _num_ wings were bad .
this place is the worst place i have ever been too .
stay away from this unprofessional establishment .
serve it with a limp iceberg and a bland dressing , that 's how .
it 's a shame to watch this place take the turn it has .
i used to love the mussels appetizer , but this visit they were awful .
after he had just patiently stood there waiting for her for over _num_ minutes .
`` cafe '' could not be slower if they tried .
the drive thru is supper dirty and the ppl there are rude !
this place is awful !
when she returns to work i realize they gave me chicken and shrimp .
my husband and i went to dq and we went through the drive through .
they argued with me and gave me a lame $ _num_ credit !
they do n't have my ink .
then they did not have the part and rescheduled for the next week !
not satisfied at all .
no go !
the store manager told the sales guy to give me an apple .
the service is terrible .
sammy is my normal barber but he messed my hair up horribly yesterday .
its all thrown in in a hurry .
it always feels crowded .

the food is lacking quality and cost is not that great .
their salsas are not spicy or flavorful .
this restaurant was very disappointing .
i do not steal , do n't have to and never have .
the staff is completely horrible and unprofessional .
the worst !
while i was eating , a coach roach ran across my table !
as such , the quality and consistency of the services are not reliable .
very rudely he asked if he should do my fix before everyone else 's .
very disappointed .
we still had to wait longer than our scheduled pick up time .
never again will i go there .
she became defensive .
again in a super loud voice we were told no .
it was easy to shop because there is not many people in the aisles .
ugh .
just did n't work out for us .
i walk away and go to the host and ask for a manager .
she said , sorry you 're next .
this place does n't deserve any stars their customer service is horrible !
when is the last time you were here '' blah blah blah .
worst hotel experience ever .
will not be coming back to this location .
food is ok but service is something that is lacking .
big mistake .

thanks _num_ star for that .
i immediately stopped eating and threw it in the trash and left disgusted .
i called _num_ different reps answered me .
sorry but extremely pissed at them and will never be back !
i asked why he was being so rude .
was not impressed .

i 'm very dissapointed .
me and my husband went here last saturday for an early dinner .

i ordered chicken strips for my daughter .
as i said before , one pass .
by far one of the worst shopping experiences i 've ever had .
she was beyond rude , even started talking down about us to the staff .
the greens were barely being watered .
some of my favorite bars have been considered dive bars .
unorganized and lack of integrity .
it was inedible .
the wait was reasonable , especially for brunch on a sunday .
so they leave you with a terrible experience every , single , time .
i paid _num_ for a no _num_ combo with a beyond small shake .
shame on you !
i 'm not talking about running a few minutes late either .
not worth the money .
that should have been washed properly , someone could get sick .
they suck , after years of going there i am done .
ultimately , it felt like being in a factory .
refuse to be treated poorly .
very disappointed in the quality of the food .
bunkers are annoying and inconsistent .
trying to get in and out is a constant challenge .
she brought me my drink , minus the straw .
this was not a pleasant experience .
i was a little disappointed with the quality and portion .
avoid coming here if you do n't have to .
went to sam 's club last sunday with my mom .
this woman has no business being in the hospitality industry .
at that point i had it and left with no food .
the receptionist threw me serious shade .
spent _num_ minutes passed that to finally be attended too .
i spent almost _num_ min laughing at just _num_ jacket .
the beef was overcooked and chewy .
no mashed potatoes .
this place was filthy ... everywhere , and the food was nasty looking .
i , and my friends will avoid that course for now .
they need to teach their employees some manners and how costumer service works !
over priced and disorganized !
my husband has had problems with this location too .
which is less than we paid for by the way .
they would n't remove it from our bill nor offer any discounts .
the sight of the food was just completely unappealing .
i am not kidding or exaggerating .
horrible service .
my family of _num_ will not be returning .
the tired bartenders are over worked and under staffed .
he got there in about _num_ minutes .
i called to help one of my employees get an apartment today .
all in all , we were really disappointed and will not return .
this hotel was the worst hotel we stayed in .
but i should have gone to a real salon .
shady area , even a security guard is walking the grounds .
hey we have been getting complaints that our pizza sucks .
maybe mongolian grills are not my thing .
it was n't any better .
just gross .
could use less sugar but whatever works .
i hate it .
this is the absolute worst walgreens i 've ever been to .
we get back home and the order was wrong .
they are cheap .
they do n't add much to the meal .
rude .
poor service .
the whole drink area was a mess as was the dining area .
not a good experience maybe a bad night for them ?
i would n't go here for a meal ever again .
we decided on may _num_ , _num_ .
her entire meal was horrible .
i have been a loyal big o customer for many years .
they give you a short wait time , but did n't deliver .
i ordered a crispy chicken classic with fries and headed back to work .
the lemonade tasted like dirt .
the medical doctor was unable to help me with a prescription i needed .
the service was nice but not worth coming back .
the cheesy bread was cheesy , crappy , and salty all rolled into one .
all i could taste was extremely burnt onions and insanely soggy bun .
this doctor was horrible .
the management was rude .
left them a voicemail and never returned my call .
i 've been wanting chicken fingers all day .
_num_ for mani gel they did n't charge me for removal .
i only go since it is on the way home from work .
which is also a place i would not want to ever go back to .
i 've had much better elsewhere .
but do n't risk the car running out of gas to come here .
i usually avoid this particular one .
no wonder they are closing down everywhere .
there care is sub-par .
owners speak little to no english .
to the lazy manager you lost a loyal customer over shrimp !
the ice cream ( yogurt ) machine is no more .
so we sat there for _num_ minutes before she even sat us .
i went in as a guest no fee charged .
i guess everyone is so used to their mcdonalds and microwave dinners .
we stopped by the drive thru sunday morning to pick up two breakfast burritos .
been here for about _num_ waiting & still have n't gotten my food .
waited _num_ minutes for breakfast at 10:30 this morning .
not a fan .
this place was by far the worst .
what i was not fine with .
the movie detail sucks .
not going to bother having another sent out because we 're so hungry .
very sad .
if i could give this place no stars , i would .
the management sucks .
ok , all done with red lobster for a good long while now .
by the time our food got to the table , our drinks were empty .
it was corned beef on a roll .
very unimpressed and wo n't be coming back again .
the orange chicken was barely warm .
not even worth to try .
the chicken alfredo was nasty .
overall would never visit that location again and would n't advise you to either .
we will not be back !
it was n't worth it .
honestly the worst service ever !
olive garden is olive garden .
but didnt think it meant getting a _num_ % cooked pizza .
i 'm disappointed to say i 'll be avoiding this one for now on .
i never got a call and a repair was never made .
never again will i go back to this restaurant .
the coupon says it 's only good tonight at the game .
do n't eat the pizza , or hang out .
rude hostess and bad customer service .
now , the one advantage i thought was present , is not .
two other customers had incorrect orders at the same time too .
the crust on a frozen pizza was better than the crust on this one .
extremely dense and hard to eat .
their service is terrible !
so i did but still not satisfied .
i have went to this location over a hundred times in high school .
hardly any sauces , and it 's totally ugly inside .
trash !
they just out some on top .
do not use this company at all seriously call someone else .
disgusting rooms ... noisy ... smelly ... loaded with homeless people ... horrible experience .
my cheese for my hashbrowns was n't melted , at all .
i could go on and on but i am sure you get the point .
my food experience was just so strange and terrible at the same time .
this store sucks .
i am not exaggerating .
finally they said it 'll be ready in _num_ mins .
this is easily the worst motel _num_ i have ever stayed in .
the meats looked like frozen , rolled up lunch meat .
in addition to being wrong , the food was absolutely disgusting .
horrible !
it is simply awful .
so , his arrival did n't help the problem .
that 's too bad .
the bad : where do i begin ?
my poor pup , with no teeth at only _num_ yrs old .
no silverware .
i spent _num_ bucks there .
my pizza was cold .
neither of them acknowledged me .
no sales help , very depressing .
not be racist but are they trying to hire any whites any time soon ?
i tell him `` sir , i 'm standing right here in line . ''
service was alright but the food was terrible .
as soon as you walk in the room it stinks .
the wings was n't that good .
pumps and bathrooms are always dirty .
do n't waste your money .
after they hook you , they do n't care .
waited _num_ minutes at the service desk .
they ca n't find my house .
the server nikki was awful , the food was mediocre at best .
if it was possible i would give it a negative star .
yuck , yuck yuck .
customer service _num_ : never argue with a customer !
it literally ruined my night .
if this is a recipe change it is not a good one .
ask for fried rice with your meal they give you chicken fried rice .
she was yelling so loud that the entire restaurant went quiet .
they keep messing up orders .
it too was similar .
i love mexican food and was craving rolled tacos with guacamole and chicken chimichanga .
last i checked _num_ minutes was _num_ hour and _num_ minutes .
come on people , the is the usa and thats coming from a hispanic !
i wo n't be staying here ever again .
flat out stinks , as in smells bad .
i walked in and no one greeted us .
pizza was disgusting .
no way .
customer service area sucks .
i would n't refer anyone to use this company .
her attitude was disgusting .
ca n't get basic orders correct .
service is n't good .
i told the lady that it was hurting and she did n't stop .
they make me feel uncomfortable to shop for wigs .
it 's ghetto and the service is incredibly horrible .
the comforter looked _num_ years old and had holes !
horrible service and dirty facility .
it was a _num_ dollar bowl for crying out loud .
so , basically , they left me waiting for that .
terrible experience .
and its not the first time that service was bad there .
when i first walked in , i was hit with that bathroom smell .
i was like no there is no way !
it simply did n't `` hit the spot '' so to speak .
no elevator .
i ca n't believe that i just paid $ _num_ for her groom .
the waiting time is just ridiculous .
with the first bite i knew it was not what i expected .
avoid this location at all cost .
no customer service at all .
i also noticed these prices were pretty stiff .
it was very busy .
just terrible !
please do n't stay here .
there are only like _num_ chairs inside .
second night the room was not cleaned and no towels .
wo n't return and threw away 3/4 of the pizza .
but on the bright side they do have hot peppers as an option .
no problem , i 'll take my business somewhere else .
this place is horrible !
we left at 6am cutting our _num_ night start to one .
nothing at all .
she just told me to pick something else .
nasty people .
i am not sure what was worse ... the food or the employees .
they lost a sale and customer for being cheap .
home depot is usually pretty good .
businesses have bad days .
i was told the wait time would be _num_ minutes .
there were a handful of flies waiting to greet us in our room .
worst motel ever !
horrible wont ever go back .
also , the noodles were halfway over cooked .
i noticed a reply on my rating .
managers name is allen wear .
i hate to give them just _num_ star .
their pharmacy staff are very rude , slow and unprofessional .
i specially asked for a non smoking room but our room smells of smoke .
there are _num_ sinks but only _num_ mirror in there too .
there was comes a time when you make bad choices .
so the salad was a fail .
the wings sucked .
this is not something the family should have to deal with !
grease with a side of food poisoning .
terrible service .
went through drive thru , ordered two _num_ piece chicken strips .
it had only been used a few times so it still looked brand new .
so do they ; why are you asking ?
i then asked how long it would take was quoted _num_ hours .
this makes my sandwhich wrapping a mess !
i ca n't wait to get rid of sprint because of this !
the sweet and sour pork , taste like chicken nuggets !
the fried outer layer was overcooked , over salted and smooth .
try a guinness or a porter , really .
turns out the hours posted are not their hours of service .
gross .
bad stink .
should n't have wasted our time .
also the golf carts were very loud .
the lady that answered was extremely rude and did n't care one dam bit .
do not get sucked into the hype of that dumb commercial .
just a mess avoid at all costs !
its not worth what they charge .
my son had a horrible experience with the staff at this complex .
the front desk never called to check if the situation had been resolved .
a month apart and now i am concerned about having another experience .
none of the six of them acknowledged me .
that is just bizarre ... at best .
this place does n't even deserve the one star i 'm giving them .
avoid this location if you can .
this was during a wine tasting event .
fridge does n't work .
walked in and was told there was a 10-15 minute wait .
the only thing worse than the room was the staff .
the potatoes were cold and so was the macaroni and cheese .
terrible .
that was _num_ weeks ago .
my wife and i thought the sauce tasted more like ketchup than pizza sauce .
while the food itself seems to taste okay .
i strongly suggest something ( anything ) else .
this is my second trip to this place and both wee bad experiences .
thank god we left at _num_ _num_ the next morning .
not to mention that is not even busy !
several others walked in behind me also with complaints on orders .
we waited for _num_ minutes and ended up leaving with no food .
for a steakhouse , some darker brews compliment the meat .
that 's not that worst part .
brooklyn boys ' alfredo blows this place out of the water !
i ca n't help but understand why sears is in such financial trouble .
the elevator button was missing for a bit on the third floor .
water glasses , dirty .
oh god in heaven : no !
the food was disgusting .
it 's like you asked them to walk _num_ miles to get some .
i say again , do n't ever ever ever ever stay at this hotel !
the wings are sorry .
do n't know ... do n't want to know .
the course is in even worse condition from when the pictures were taken .
that was bad sign # _num_ .
the meat was like a lunch meat instead of real sliced deli beef .
what different oil choices do i have ?
the cheese bread was yummy as well !
not so much .
they deserve a star .
still no server at this point .
in sum , a very bad experience .
terrible customer service couldnt even tell me how much was on a gift card .
first impression when i walk into the place is the smell of dirty carpets .
husband ordered the ribeye and it too was cooked well done .
more importantly , the food sucked .
had an attitude and got orders wrong .
this place has horrible customer service .
it is the stuff of nightmares .
anyhow , i think there are probably better places to eat in the area .
nothing was ever mentioned about smoking rooms .
their pineapple was bad .
i would give zero stars if possible .
horrible store !
it was like our couch was made from three leftover pieces they had .
i would be embarrassed to call this my golf course .
my boyfriend got orange chicken and teriyaki chicken so we could share everything .
the carrot and celery sticks are mushy and off color .
this last trip may have been the breaking point .
do not go here .
i never understood party favors .
place is in desperate need of some renovation .
but what was n't acceptable was the salt level in the food .
got ripped off big time .
maybe she was confused to what i meant ?
i ended up waiting almost _num_ mins which was inconvenient .
they toasted my bread and popped the corned beef in the microwave .
stay as far away from this place as possible .
the attitude just gets worse as you 're shopping and checking out .
you get what you pay for ... stayed here to visit family in goodyear .
there were many customer dogs in the store , and nobody was petting them !
he does not know how to operate the business .
-- with said gross !
they also left a greasy hand print on my light grey interior .
they get my order wrong .
not the food but the service .
the staff is rude , unpleasant and just a bad experience .
food was warm that was suppose to be cold and chicken wings were old .
i went to wendy 's across the street and had food in _num_ minutes .
the bathroom was disgusting .
i wanted to give you zero stars but it would n't let me .
they throw everything in very sloppy .
i would stay away from this restaurant .
pretty sad , really .
we walked in and the place was dirty and not well lit .
the customer service was very lousy today .
no child or baby here .
i could n't find a mirror to save my life !
i guess that is not the case .
get a life , worse pizza in town !
i really do n't get why people come here so often .
why why why ?
the guacamole tasted watery and bland .
we could n't tell who worked there and who did n't .
if i could give negative rating omg i would .
why do they charge so much to use credit cards ?
needless to say we spent too much money for a not very satisfying meal .
i would n't recommend this place to anyone .
i 'm not surprised this subway only has _num_ star !
i would suggest they hire someone with more experience working with customers .
we did n't have to wait very long before our meal was delivered .
_num_ star for that and another for the yummy biscuits .
i have n't been in awhile because of these reasons .
the blankets were paper thin .
the food is not cooked all the way , and , none wears gloves .
do not eat here .
to add to that , they are super slow !
all the sides were wrong .
i am sad to see how much this place has gone downhill .
i would give this place a negative score if possible .
the tiles on the steps were cracked and missing chunks .
do not use this company .
it 's the worst pizza i 've ever had .
no words for this experience .
the food was n't bad , but it did lack flavor .
locker rooms disgusting , smelly .
looked at the bottom of container barely any sauce .
zero stars just the middle finger .
make him put his weights away !
do not get tamales with baja sauce ... it 's mush .
but now there 's no way i 'll ever go back .
only reason i gave them _num_ star is because i had to .
cops always seem to be here .
he was a total ass .
only wish i could have given them _num_ stars .
my standards are n't met .
not sure ?
for app , we got the stuffed mushrooms with shrimp and lobster .
whose **** do i need to suck to get a drink around here ?
i took my _num_ yr old dog into her first teeth cleaning last week .
cold potato , the cheese would n't even melt .

do not stay here .
floor and ceiling look like they have been rode hard and hung up wet .
how rude !
good food but poor cleanliness apparently .
when we received our order it was missing country gravy on both our hashbrowns .
that should have been my first clue .
absolute worst banking experience i have ever had .
bad bed very poor sleep .
worst service i 've ever experienced .
victor in the paint department never called back like he said .
the hotel staff could n't have cared about anyone one .
the experience was awful and they should have more caring people handling our requests .
zero customers , food took forever .
not joking _num_ freakin minutes i was in there and i was gone .
serves bad and slow .
very very disappointing .
did n't care if we needed anything .
i saw them put _num_ small containers front of me and said no .
i 'm only giving one star because i ca n't give zero .
this place is run down for a safeway .
why are the fast food chains always so busy ?
but lack of integrity , i am looking somewhere else this evening .
i pushed ignore .
food is n't good .
the wheat bread was not very good , and too thick .
but no one told me !
the food was cold and did not meet expectations .
first , the driver was super late to pick up our stuff .

then someone suggested leaving a yelp review , so here i am .
i was so very disappointed .
host was friendly , waiter jeremy was super nice and manager was all smiles .
i tried a side of cole slaw and it seemed very processed .

i wish i could give this place negative stars .
they tried telling us we drove _num_ miles !
wo n't be back .
he went to prepare our food without washing his hands .
i ordered the teriyaki chicken and it was a little bland .
we opened the door to the room , it smelled .
in general , this petsmart just was not a fun place to be .
going in with coworkers for a quick bite to eat i ordered the nachos .
i just had a horrible experience with this location .
i also asked for hot sauce , guess what i got instead ?

lady was really rude .
this location deserves zero stars !
they do n't live up to their name .

it was just a very unpleasant meal .
there were no one playing , no one .
the restrooms did n't work , toilet paper everywhere .
horrible gym and service !
lots of issues with the games not working and not giving tickets out .
like money was brought up a lot .

we could n't wait till he was gone .
it was n't horrible tasting food , just bland for what i prefer .
horrible customer service !

it was pretty odd for an almost empty restaurant .
the star is for me and my seasoning additions !
bomb wings but slow service .
service and food are disgusting .
i was there yesterday , and the line was nine customers deep .
no refills on drinks were offered while we were there .
at the very best it should have been under $ _num_ for it all .
unfortunately we had o option then to stay there .
waited _num_ minutes just for bread .
will not be eating little caesars ever again .
i have never had such terrible service , especially from management as well .

man , was he rude .
i think that 's totally awesome .
this was not good .
three of my large furniture pieces were damaged .
they are rude and dirty .
dogs were wandering all over the complex without their owners .
now this place is just a serious dive with little to no redeeming qualities .
i was very unimpressed with this store .
wo n't be this place .
we walk up and wait a bit in line , no big deal .
the equipment they had was really outdated and painful .
they were naturally cold so we asked for something a little fresher .

i hate them for not giving me the option by calling me first .
i do n't know what happened but the crust is not the same .
not really i heard you talking about your relationship .
the third order our garlic knots were burnt and hard .
first , the cashier clearly did n't want to be there .
she spoke english when she took my money .
i was there just as long as if i had ordered in the store .
for some reason , my room had some strawberry jelly all over the place .

i hardly doubt they reached their limit on a tuesday but who knows .
worst experience ever !
bad !

everything was so very salty .
really , that 's not too much to change , right ?
the crust was plain and there was a lot of it .
no flavor .
crappy buffet .
im pissed !
when i arrived to pick it up they did n't have it .
unfortunately we will never make the mistakes of going to this location again !
very disappointment , customer service very poor and food was not good .
i did n't really care where i was going to stay .
is only about _num_ bucks .
the restrooms were a disaster !
the room is simple with a small electric stove , sink , and microwave .
my one take spoon of blue cheese dressing to go with it was ok .
we literally could n't eat our dinner .
this place is for the cheap and dirty sort .
terrible customer service , staff arguing with each other .
i 'm not going back there next time .
the waiter said i could n't take the shrimp home because it was unlimited .
then i waited another _num_ for a cappuccino that was cold when ordered hot .
i tried to complain and the chick acted like she did n't speak english .
it a hole in the wall in the middle of crack haven .
we will not be coming back .

i went once and refused to go back .
i did n't eat much of it .
i could not believe it .
from outside this place looks sketchy at best .

is it too much to ask for a courtesy call ?
sometimes i have to repeat no , this store in particular .
he sure as hell didnt .

order _num_ simple things was told 30-45 min which is find .
luckily no one here cares that they serve you horrible food .
said she 'd be back with it , never returned with one .
there is trash and food all over it .
it had very little sauce and very little cheese .
could hardly find the mozzarella either .
just flat out rude .
they really need to get some workers in there that know how to cook .
finally the food comes , and of course , the order is wrong .
and the salad looked old .
maybe it was a bad day , but .
there was no sign or anything to say i could n't park there .
make sure you have time to burn , my mani/pedi took over two hours !
not smart and maybe not final .
she did n't file my nails nor even clean them out .
i would not have payed more otherwise .
the service was poor and the atmosphere did n't feel clean .
almost like a smokey smell mixed with bad bo .
i had the biscuit egg , bacon , and cheese sandwich and the waffle .
our waitress , andrea , was nice , though quite rushed .
is n't this dinner time ?
this is the third time in a row , we will not be returning !
half the lights do n't work .
i ordered fried lasagna which was burned .
very rude , will not come back .
this place was ridiculous .

this does n't even come close .
that seems incredibly unacceptable .
nightmares of hungry people and no food ... .
it was a empty bar .
totally inappropriate for any family restaurant in my opinion .
half the time they ca n't get my order right .
no patience at all !
other than that i do n't know who else could appreciate this place .
i requested a tow to coach works on a tuesday after hours .
i would n't recommend this stupid place at all !
go back and have bad service again and spend more $ ?
stopped by for a local , fire grilled burger .
it 's now to the point where it 's disgusting .
chicken was best described as canned chicken .
stand in line and get to the front but no pizza .
so he offered to replace the _num_ piece white with _num_ dark meat choices .
a month later , i still had not received my dryer back .
do not stop here if you are wanting fast service .
so he proceeded to hand me my order and then asked for the money .
will never , ever visit this establishment again !
after slow service this morning i decided to look up this business on yelp .
i got there and they only had one _num_ pack .
it was pretty awful .
really over an hour behind and nothing .
for the soup , i went with the chicken & gnocchi .
i do n't want to spend 10-15 additional minutes of my lunch hour waiting .
overall , i was not impressed and regret going .
... not friendly !
i do n't know smh .
the pedicure at most lasted _num_ mins .
this hotel was the worst i have ever stayed in and felt very unsafe .
we leave and walk the mall .
no toppings , just soft serve vanilla ice cream .
i will be contacting groupon to get a refund .
i do n't like big brother hovering over my shoulder .
ridiculous .
it would have been fine or i would have went else where .
the place was dirty with screaming children running around out of control .
frankly , i know better than to order wings from a national chain store .
bad sign # _num_ .
he just did n't care about being there .
i do n't know how they got such good reviews .
they ran out of pumpkin cheesecake .
this means for over a month i will have no refrigerator .
walked in and no hello from the bartender .
we were so disappointed the chicken fried sirloin is so terrible .
apparently , i was not the only one with the roach issue .
this place was freezing cold inside !
phoenix az ... .
the only answer i got was prices are different after certain hours .
ca n't even supply their shoppers with shopping carts .
the problem is the management & the maintenance staff do not fix anything .
$ _num_ for two _num_ oz steaks _num_ salad bar .
whatever you can imagine being bad ... it is .
no , we are locals .
do n't fall for this .
the equipment is outdated .
goodbye macayo 's , you will be missed .
our main course came out before the soup !
i , along with a couple of friends visited this place last friday night .
bad customer service .
i did n't want to drink out of my glass .
it added unfortunate stress to an already stressful day .
overall , would not return .
it was _num_ degrees today .
unfortunately i ca n't so i have to give them one .
it never fails .
then she asks me what entree .
do n't waste your money here if you are looking for a meal .
that is n't cool .
unfortunately it 's the closest one to our house .
which my mom was sitting at who uses a walker and has trouble moving .
the meat is dark , fatty , and does n't even taste like chicken .
it did n't take long to figure out what it was .
i really do n't know if it was water .
no apology .
i air dried from my shower instead .
upon entering , the atmosphere was just ok .
parking is horrible !
( this was done a week previous to this . )
another _num_ minutes go by i called back she then told me _num_ minutes .
she handed me the mirror and said `` what do you think ? ''
even my brother did n't want to finish them .
how can you mess up a greek salad ?
and another _num_ mins just to get our check .
not a big fan .
not only is the service terrible , the management is terrible .
well , no kidding !
the selection was better but probably because it 's a ghost town at metro .
i ca n't do that .
phones calls most of the times ignored , they never returned my call .
people have bad days .
this location is horrible .
meaning mexican style fajita cooking .
she did n't apologize for the error .
so sad .
the non-smoking room reeked , but that was n't even the start .
the entire visit lasted two and a half hours .
bathrooms were disgusting .
this restaurant does not know how to make them .
motorcycle !
only one star because i have to .
she tries to upsell me on the meal , i say no .
he could n't breath .
just went back this weekend .
however , this is a school .
will not be back ever and filed a complaint !
i assure you , i have no problem paying my way .
so frustrating .
will not come back ... this place has no windows ?
doctor said that i had food poisoning from poorly maintained meat .
when we received our order of wings , they were cold .
the store is very busy from 8am to about 10pm at night .
you wo n't get good sleep due to being worried about your vehicle .
the place was crowded on monday morning ( labor day ) .
i do n't care if it 's only $ _num_ .
the waitress then offered to refill our bread basket .
sat down to eat .
it just looked like the bed had been made and that 's it .
the stink when i opened the door to my room was really awful .
i was very unsatisfied with the food .
took _num_ minutes to get our drinks and the order was wrong .
the worst experience i have ever had at an enterprise location .
come on now that is ridiculous .
i highly recommend that you never go here unless you want to get frustrated .
the customer service is horrible !
we also pressed the button _num_ times to get someone .
_num_ stars .
they always mess up my order and give me the wrong food .
so i ordered a salad instead .
but i can try to texture it . ''
i ordered the cheese ravioli with tomato sauce .
wait lets not talk about it !
do n't eat at this place .
they do n't have a separate person working the drive through window .
that said , the carpets were disgusting .
i love the wings but they are n't worth the beyond terrible service .
the only good thing about this place is that its cheap .
first impression : the place is really really dirty .
she did agree to adding a order of fries free of charge .
do not go here and waste your money !
i still want my old hole in the wall lenny 's back .
i wanted to like it , i really did .
but domino 's is at least on par with pizza hut and papa johns .
so rude !
to top it off the food was prepared with no gloves .
i ca n't see what other people see in this place .
they are never apologetic for this by the way .
was told it 's a _num_ minute wait .
when i entered the store , i did not smell one sense of food .
unhappy and unsatisfied .
the service the last time i went was just terrible .
$ _num_ plus tax for two people , one bowl each !
the carne was flavorless and the fries were cold and mushy .
<UNK> negative
i 'm glad i got this for such a cheap price through hotwire .
so i been looking for a year .
but there came a point that i could ignore no more .
waiter dropped off food and never came back !
needless to say i will not be returning !
worst food and customer service ever .
got a groupon deal that said i would get a synthetic blend oil change .
always busy dirty and smells like cigarette buds .
first off we were treated rudely over the drive thru order radio .
online pick up you better be ready for long delays .
i was disappointed to see the prior yelp page removed - why ?
customers do n't have time to lie about a damn membership .
i had never been to a texas roadhouse quite like this one .
i asked them to put it on rye instead because that would taste better .
the place is dirty and disgusting .
we are late for our concert at this point and beyond frustrated .
i would not recommend this salon , nor will i be returning .
over cooked and disgusting .
i will not recommend anyone to this location or any of their franchise period .
i will not be returning to this location .
stay away from here as i will !
not advertised as a special , just a normal item .
the salad was heavy on the onions , easy on the anything else .
never again shall i use this spot .
not the best mexican resturant we 've been to , but it 's cheap !
this particular petsmart is no exception .
but i do n't feel my vehicle is safe outside .
the carpet had at least _num_ stains .
i gave _num_ star for the side dishes .
anyway , i saw _num_ shirt that was semi cute .
i felt bad for the owners of this arizona staple .
poor customer service , poor quality pizza .
_num_ am and no place to sleep .
worst delivery ever .
the manager said well i talk to her .
walked out of this place after _num_ min of no service .
rude management , tasteless food , overpriced .
the beer is still cold and good .
i used to love olive garden but its become so blah .
i guess i need to spell that out more clearly next time .
poor customer service .
the only thing different is that they refilled the paper towel dispenser .
we gave up on getting him off our backs and walked out without ordering .
there was nothing special .
filthy restrooms with no paper towels .
no apologies , nothing .
the food just did n't taste fresh .
i asked for _num_ queen beds and got _num_ double beds .
service was below average but not terrible .
i 'll spend my money where it 's welcome .
service was fast but poor .
the food was awful .
very bad business !
i may shop there again - not ( unless pig 's fly ) .
the manager was yelling at the cashier while we placed our order .
it just would n't be worthwhile .
it was terrible .
now i remember why i do n't like olive garden .
i have better tacos at home using fry 's brand of taco seasoning .
so for _num_ , i would skip this place !
do n't buy the groupon .
any two different items _num_ .
it was our first time at red lobster , and probably our last .
the customer service that i experienced here was on par with any other salon .
the point of having a _num_ hour location is for convenience .
but it reminds me off chinese food prepared for a mexican clientele .
the communication with this store was awful !
i sat down and waited .
next , the total was $ _num_ ( i also ordered a blizzard ) .
i gave him the same instructions on how to cut my hair like always .
so me and the wife went here _num_ weeks ago .
horrible customer service .
otherwise it would get zero stars from me .
i ran out of this place and i will never ever come back !
big huge mistake .
you 're not going to find any of that useful shit at party city .
hate the service .
all i ate there was crunchy rice and soy sauce .
when the food finally arrived , it was n't anything spectacular .
she then did not follow the comment up with a reason !
can never get things fixed .
the burrito was big but only fair tasting .
made an appointment to get my oil changed at 8am on june 2nd .
are you freaking kidding me ?
the sides were terrible .
but i have to get this off my chest .
not very tasty , not authentic sopapillas .
it took me _num_ minutes just to drive there one way .
also the manager is racist & they do not accept section _num_ anymore .
this was my last visit to any outback .
all the _num_ star reviews are very odd to me .
if we had waited any longer , they all would have been dead !
she would have ignored me completely had i not called for her attention .
the buildings are semi quiet , ca n't complain about that .
i will never set foot inside another macayo 's again .
it is tacky to the touch and uneven .
very sub par place .
which is pretty sad since it 's for children .
it took them two days to come out and fix my fridge .
no one is behind me not no line .
the customer service is usually awful and the cashier lines are rarely ever open .
the cashier do n't understand you and the order was messed up .
i am not sure what the big deal is about this place .
the sheets , comforter , and towels were stained .
it might actually be worse than little caesar 's or peter piper .
i would give this place negative stars if i could .
our wait for food was _num_ minutes -- no joke .
that 's too bad cause this is the closest sears to my house .
sauce tastes old and left over .
slow service , mediocre mexican food .
i really hate coming here .
they need a serious remodeling and to clean this mess up .
sure would like to know why ?
absolutely terrible service from our waitress .
had we had any other choices , we would have taken them .
it was n't my idea to come .
no , just the regular oil change , thanks .
two thumbs down .
not really fried rice , just seasoned rice .
she started yelling and giving me bad attitude .
sadly , it took another five mins for our food to arrive , incorrectly .
sat down and saw people getting seated that came in after i did .
_num_ hours after we ordered they want to know where to take the pizza .
only good thing was the toasted bun .
but yesterday was a disaster .
worst mongolian bbq i 've ever had .
i washed my hands and there were no paper towels .
if i could give this a negative star , i would .
she welcomed us and said hello as soon as we walked in .
the door would not open .
is their clientele so vast that they can afford to treat people like crap ?
first off , this place is beyond crowded !
unacceptable !
my pillow case had a burned hole in it .
this is the worst excuse for italian food ever .
he gave me my money back .
the next morning , we found that the water temperature would n't stay steady .
the steak had absolutely no taste .
waffles were looking good .
his customers service skills are poor at best .
needless to say , i have n't been back since .
i have been here _num_ times .
buying here was the mistake of the year .
burns in the blankets and little dead bugs on top of bed !
but why would i , i did n't suspect them .
nothing to write home about , but i 'll write it on yelp .
however i will never do business there again .
our waitress seemed rushed and never even came back to refill waters .
still ca n't beat a $ _num_ foot long .
yesterday on my lunch break i was craving carne fries .
i want my old lenny 's back .
i sent my boyfriend within ten mins to go pick our dinner up .
needless to say we left and will not be back .
i asked if i could get one from an empty room .
this gym i way over do for an upgrade .
my husband thought the soup was good and the egg roll was crispy .
mattress is _num_ months old .
she said nothing to me .
slow slow slow !
after this experience , we 're not sure if we want to return .
i was ate wings but i taste weird .
the waiter would disappear and hardly checked on us .
this is a corporate vet and everything bad that corporate vets do .
the office never answers their phone and does n't return any messages .
i could n't even bring myself to finish one bowl .
windows have n't been cleaned in years you can see scum on them .
terrible experience do n't recommend to anybody .
pharmacy staff is rude .
i also notice that floor was really and there was no wet floor sign .
manager said i could pay more to get a synthetic o change .
was not immediately impressed when i walked in .
the food was disgusting and gross .
i took my parents and unfortunately we were very disappointed .
i had to choose _num_ star otherwise , i could n't post this review !
$ _num_ wi-fi charge .
first off the customer service was terrible .
another _num_ minutes goes by .
the hostess was very unfriendly .
bad business decision , in my opinion .
plus gum on the arm of the chair ( gross ) oh and chips .
would leave _num_ stars if i could .
so i asked again for the manager and explained the situation .
if i ever come to phoenix to visit i will not be staying here .
worst service ever .
no drink order .
abandoned motel next door with its windows busted out .
if you go in make sure you do not get brian !
i declined the box and left my leftovers at the restaurant .
then an hour goes by no food .
this was awful pizza .
she just was n't good with people .
i literally could n't believe what had happened .
honestly this is one of the worst food dining experiences i have ever had .
save your money and get a $ _num_ hot n ' ready !
if you do n't you wo n't get any .
as soon as she saw me she knew why i was there .
# _num_ missing light bulbs in the light fixtures # _num_ .
wth , potatoes or hash browns & eggs are what makes a breakfast burrito .
this is when things started to get ugly .
i do n't understand why they do n't do dressing either .
it is tolerable maybe once but not four times .
the decor was a lot nicer than i was expecting too .
this does not make any sense .
their comics are also in poor condition .
call the front desk and request one , this is approx .
my partner thought it too sour .
he did n't care that my daughter had gotten sick .
ordered a large supreme and it had next to no meat veggies on it .
and left , never to return .
probably the worst olive garden i have been to .
i told him that is not my issue .
maybe i am just visiting at the wrong time .
there where _num_ waiters , still service was slow .
it was awkward and frustrating .
and the exterior is just as bad .
the customer service is none the girls and the cook are rude .
maybe that 's why the inside of the restaurant was so dead .
instead , they made everything so much hard and more painful .
why are they taking over all the airports , stations , and rest stops ?
if i could give lower , i would .
my second visit just got worse .
worst customer service in any target .
i do n't recommend .
it was bad .
i was disappointed .
ordered the family pack which included _num_ wings , fries and garlic bread .
i asked if she could void the transaction and again i got a no .
this one is trashy !
got the salad , it was ok .
it was hot but i noticed immediately , no pizza aroma !
i gave them a call and never answered .
the cheese is different , the crust is different .
this is a oil change express station with two servicing stations .
they were out of mushrooms , so i expected more veggies on it .
but they wo n't be getting any further business from me .
however , now as an adult the experience was not the same .
walgreen 's is dead to me .
i would recommend not going to this place ever !
do n't come here without expecting do wait over _num_ mins .
gravy and side of corn were so salty it ruined the meal .
this company is complete fraud .
i am absolutely disgusted with this store .
i have to say , i find the meat to be super sketchy .
this even longer story short , they changed my oil .
someone did n't clean the place thoroughly .
mediocre quality , at best .
no problem right stuff happens .
promised glasses would be ready for pickup within _num_ to _num_ business days .
but , the food was terrible .
this place was filthy !
they get _num_ stars for the huge portions .
myself and my family will not be returning to the place .
do n't plan on finding quality product at low prices .
extremely disappointed .
the `` sour '' is n't in the name to make it sound pretty .
it 's very loud , unclean and humans there buy everything .
the water was barely flowing .
worse than the super _num_ on chandler .
why would n't she tell me that from the beginning ?
i had it transferred to another location and got my meds in _num_ mins .
my husband and i came here because we were missing the seafood back home .
my baby is crying , im hungry , an this is just dumb ... .
office max has officially lost my business .
every time i drive by the store i 'm reminded of the horrible experience .
not impressed .
we will be searching for another vet and not coming back to this location .
just uncomfortable .
to start off i wish i could give them zero stars .
the place was filthy and the woman behind the counter was incredibly rude .
employees are so rude here .
i was extremely disappointed with our experience .
the food has never been much more than convenient .
they 've gotten my order wrong every time !
i 'm not sure the food was old or it 's a food poisoning .
saw the show and came to see _num_ stars , forget it .
the seating sucks .
my pasta was so dry that it was almost sticking together .
this place seriously needs more tellers .
luckily i had cash so i paid her for exactly what i had ordered .
no food ready but asked if i could pay now .
incredibly rude .
so disappointing .
why am i still surprised when companies are unethical and dishonest ?
lame .
my boyfriend and i recently drove cross country .
how else can one explain the _num_ and _num_ stars for this place ?
it was awful .
there is no plug for the the drain .
so in conclusion , this store ... do n't , just ... do n't .
also the shower had no hot water and no water pressure .
stop by for a beer sat .
i 'm not even kidding , it was falling off .
i am not even gon na go into prices or anything .
any chain restaurant , for that matter , has better pizza .
* the office manager anna is insanely rude .
let alone the store manager was snotty and rude !
just a terrible location .
i would never take my jewelry here again .
( point here : texas roadhouse does n't have them ) .
my hubby and i frequent this waffle house , usually late at night .
i reserved a room with _num_ double beds no smoking .
every encounter i have had with her ... she is always rude or angry .
not a regular roach a huge sewer roach .
called in a delivery order from this location and it was late .
long story short , _num_ of us returned our meals as they were nasty .
the rest of the food items were just gross .
i was blatantly ignored and when i asked again .
do n't go back to baskin and robbins !
no service !
this is by far the worst nail salon i have been too .
these must have been frozen at some point , they were watery and tasteless .
there 's reasonable room to park at least just not enough of them .
any other store , one could request a price check .
my appetizer was cold , half of the bowl of muscles were closed .
tip to all the panda express managers .
there are no mirrors !
and the cashier was a complete bitch .
we should have gotten up and walked out to go someplace else .
disgusting !
her potato was burnt and dry .
not to mention , they messed up on my dad 's order .
do n't bother renting here .
the greeter when you walk in does n't smile .
she did n't even realize that we already had our food .
only taking cash at the moment which sucks !
it did n't ring up so the cashier called someone .
so my wings came out _num_ mins before pizza was done .
it has n't been for quite a few years .
needless to say , we all stopped eating and felt sick to our stomachs .
fed up i called the district manager .
_num_ minutes after ordering : grills broken , no hotdogs .
several trays were empty , and were not refilled .
nothing was working .
when entering , i was willing to give the techs a chance .
i wish i 'd gone to the big apple instead .
not cuz of the hair but because of the mediocre food .
would n't recommend this dentist to anyone .
will never visit this location again !
no apology or nothing !
i left my purchases there along with another customer .
the place was n't even busy at this time .
just got a peter piper pizza for the 1st time in awhile .
i ordered them with no guacamole , add extra cheese .
shame .
i did n't have tub , just a shower with a seat .
even the ice cream for dessert lacks luster .
my pedicure , however , turned out okay with minimal polish on the skin .
please beware they are looking for a buck at your expense !
i gave my friend money to purchase me food for lunch .
this was the most disgusting place i 've stayed in a long time .
i went to red lobster today with my family the service was horrible .
do not move here !
not by a long shot !
service here sucked .
it sure was quick , but , come on !
poor poor customer service .
he was very unhelpful and rude .
i have to say it 's the worst smelling la fitness in the valley .
worst ever .
terrible service !
it was a thick burger smothered with salty onions , mushrooms & cheese .
_num_ hours later it was ready .
i travel _num_ miles further to the peoria location which is much nicer .
i had to get off freeway and return them .
food was `` meh '' , maybe i just ordered the wrong thing .
really old washers and dryers that seem to run super loudly .
the past _num_ years they have really gone down hill .
the orange chicken was not good .
bland .
i waited for _num_ minutes to open to replace my battery .
the worst customer service ever !
the dish was very bland .
crappy customer service .
i kept telling her no but she continued to insist she must come in .
absolute worst experience .
service - sketchy ... um appetizers are served before the entree not after .
the egg was overcooked .
i wish i would have gone with them !
do not order from here they are the worst !
the most awful place to move to !
i was sadly disappointed .
this place was like a ghost town and no one could even acknowledge us .
wtf i took the room and headed to 3rd floor hell .
they need table cloths , spotless glasses , uniforms , and managing .
they were a soggy , greasy , tasteless mess .
they said the van was there but could n't find us .
cold fries .
it was really disgusting , so i contacted my manager .
the service was very very very very very slow , and a wrong order .
wow this place is bad .
the sandwich was dressed with a not so tasty dressing .
very dangerous area it is infested with scorpions .
i really expected so much more but was completely disappointed .
so of course i am going to use the vet visit .
horrible customer service and very rude front desk lady .
my husband and i were dining here for valentines day last year .
i can deal with poor customer service , but finding glass in a biscuit ?
the chicken was sliced , grilled , and tasted like it was microwaved .
unfortunately my last experience on friday was horrible !
asked for fried rice and honey sesame chicken .
i should not have gone .
the greens are too hard and do n't hold approach shots .
i would n't write a review on a franchise unless it pissed me off .
they are not compassionate or understanding to my condition .
this was our cue to leave .
i would rather be dirty than stay one more min in this place .
also way too much cheese .
this place sucks !
unfortunately , i am unable to say the same about my experience here today .
no one should wait for what i had to wait for .
the least they could do was substitute tenders in place of breast .
the fiesta potatoes are never cooked all the way through .
this hotel sucks .
may i recommend the apricot chicken or mixed grill ?
i do n't know , though , just my opinion .
i would n't trust danny 's to do anything to my truck .
had a terrible meal here from start to finish .
other pizza places always put dips and napkins when you buy pizza from them .
service was a bit slow and not that friendly .
there was hardly any ice cream at all in mine .
having to wait a long time for just my drink .
afterwards , i went about my various errands for the day .
i have nothing nice to say .
getting by bed delivered was a pain .
another purse had been put into the dust cover in its place .
my dough was mushy , crust was soft and had no crisp to it .
extremely long wait time .
i drive back there and wait in line to return my food .
i totally regret ordering from them .
will never play here again after playing here today .
nothing bad ; but nothing exciting either .
they messed up my order and then did n't want to fix it correctly .
however i have two main complaints that result in such a low rating .
been here for years but they can never get it right .
never again will i go here .
unfortunately eating some taco bell would be a better choice .
do n't even hang out in the parking lot .
i ca n't imagine that they did n't give me napkins or dips .
i lost my appetite .
do not trust these people with your card !
drug deals out in the parking lot .
very disappointing food and waste of my time .
i had to tell one of the managers but they did n't care .
is n't that a little bit unethical ?
i was told because the neighborhood is bad .
