the last time i did it was a year ago .

i still have privacy screen , after num_num months .
i dropped phone once and the case held up perfectly .
the same panel buttons are there but in a better placement .
the measuring spoons would make a great stocking stuffer for any kitchen queen .
it s still going great , i just needed more capacity .
i though it would be faster and easier but it wasn t .
just do your homework and you will end up pretty satisfied .

i had installed two of these for the front entrance of our house .
this little butter bell is a fantastic buy .
the braun has it all . this is my second programmable <UNK> .
great charger , though there may be cheaper options .
i would definitely recommend this for a cute case .
i have not been able to stop using it .
i use this as a little office supply shelf .
i would have given a five star if the packaging with some bubble wrap .
i have to say that it was money well spent .
overall i love them , and would probably buy them again .
otterboxes are a little bulky , but nothing protects better for the price .
it s probably my phone but it happens constantly since i got the battery .
it fulfills my modest requirements , and exceeds my expectations in appearance .
the head set is quite comfortable at least for me .
very easy to put on , no bubbles whatsoever .
so i purchased another knife sharpener for this our num_num yankee swap .
the copper finish is coated with a clear plastic to prevent oxidation .
these come in handy with those tender special moments and <UNK> .

i ve been using this for months , and like it very much .
the cheese came out light and fluffy wished i had had one earlier .
loved the deffender case hated the apple phone .
i have had to replace the paddles as they wore out .
that s what it does and it does it well .
fair price . x x x x x x x x xx x .

it s a very good quality at a <UNK> price .
when purchased i discovered there was a newer product update : model num_extend
the cookbook that comes with it is adequate .
i have read reviews from wine experts that it doesn t work .
it stores in a really small place and is built to last .
it would have been perfect if it was a tad bit smaller .
i think this case is a very nice phone case .
it keeps the air clean and nice fresh smelling .
one to another company and two to amazon . com .
i have no doubt that it will hold up well through the years .
there are num_num blue lights to indicate the level of the unit s charge .
these wine stoppers are very inexpensive and certainly do the job .

this product is being used for dollar size pancakes .
very sturdy with a good selection of teeth sizes .
no complaints and my wife loves the color .
it was just one and that s not a big deal .
we have used ours at least a couple of hundred times .
wish it had a crank or something to make it easier .
i would recommend to anyone who wants a pda .
carrots will leave a big orange smear on the surface .
but it s not bad for wireless , i ve had worse .
now i just need to buy a catch can for the bottle tops .
for the size , weight and price it is really worth it .
i use this with <UNK> to clean my cook top .
this cover does exactly what it is designed to do .
i recommand smaller size for everyday use . but i like this pan .
open carefully and handle the zippers with care .
then both of them go into the dishwasher .
i had it a long time now and i still love it .
it works great and i am very happy with it .
this is the old faithful water filter pitcher .
it comes at a good price and appears to be well made .
only issue is the blue light it becomes a annoying after a while .
great dutch oven , works well and fun to use on camping trips .
i bought this protective cover case for num_num cents plus shipping .
i never thought about making cheese until <UNK> <UNK> made some on her show .
and it s a bread knife and nothing all that special .
i paid $ for this when i bought a few other pieces .
what a change in my life this will make .
i have owned it for two years and it is a work horse .
it was just what i expected it to be .
heavy , patterned glass , and very classy looking on the table .
finish is great , and it makes great french toast .
they get into the corners as described and are flexible yet firm .
i never have problems answering the phone this way with my blackberry .
i put my kitchen appliances through the ringer .
i installed this on a <UNK> sliding window .
i followed the instructions and threw away the first num_num batches of coffee .
that is sufficiently minor as to not affect my rating .
purchased this to charge my new android tablet in the car on trips .
it makes it easy and neat to store and access all of your scarves .
i can t believe how strong this little guy is .
there is no warming plate in the unit but it doesn t need one .
i liked this and was happy with my purchase .
i like it better than any of the forman items .
i mainly use my <UNK> now but haven t sold the vitamix yet .
love it ! really handy to set by the stove .
we use these alot and they work great .
i can t believe that i didn t buy these sooner .
i purchased these batteries based on the reviews of others .
either you will like it , or you won t .
it holds the charge like when my phone was brand new .
i ve had this thermometer for about num_num years .
it s almost like putting the phone into a high end pair of socks .
i shall be ordering a second one in the not too distant future .
blocking the red hot coils from my cookie sheets , and glassware .
i can t remember when i first bought this timer .
the la <UNK> ran about half a shot then choked the machine .
i sprinkle a little flour on the rolls before stamping to prevent sticking .
i have had this mount for about a year and it works great .
i used to use a good cooks brand safety opener and really liked it .
they pile up nice in the closet and clean up great in the dishwasher .
i ve owned this crock pot for several years .
well worth the money , wouldn t want to be without it .
however , this is an example of how rosle got it right .
i use this thing to core out the inside of a potato .
we juiced our garden lettuce and greens with ease .
it can t be tightened at that point to fix it .
simple ! does the job it was intended for .
making <UNK> and cross contamination containment a very easy .
all my testing proves the same . hope that helps .
i also like the adjustable heat option for the warming plate .
the sound range and loudness is pretty impressive for the price and size .
make sure the pins line up with the contacts .
we usually run it on low and it is relatively quite .
i ve had to repair it a few times as it s % plastic .
the price was good , and came quickly though my prime membership .
a must have if you have one of the older <UNK> .
careful when using steak knives however because they will scratch these plates .
still it is a fun learning experience and so far so good .
i love cooking and you need sharp knives when cooking .
i estimate that four trips were made to empty and refill the water compartments .
these type <UNK> have been around a long time .
but the back side looks nice as well .
the aluminum ones get stained and ugly after a few uses .
i finally made he purchase and am glad i did .
washing it is a breeze and just takes a second .
doesn t really reduce the fat anymore than most cooking methods .
but this one does the job very nicely .
but i like the phone to be up higher on the windshield . recommended .
i also prefered the blade weight and thickness of the wustof .
durable and seems similar quality to apple products .
not that anything sticks that much you just don t have to worry .
the otterbox defender series is by far the best available .
the cord is extra heavy to resist tangling .
i have two of them in different locations in my house .
snug fit , with all the buttons and holes perfectly aligned .
but for now , i m quite happy with this .
i purchased this filter for a braun num_extend coffeemaker .
i am glad that i did not spend a fortune on the electric models .
it had a great cost and a great product .
i think that is the way to keep the fish moist .
replaced my pampered chef garlic press with this one .
as stated by the many reviews , this is an <UNK> carpet cleaner .
very good price but this one harder to use than my cusinart .
this will compete with any top of the line knife you can buy .
place it in the freezer and close the door .
then i used the <UNK> on my furniture and the water was gray .
so , to me this is pretty darn instant .
i m a fan of symbian and find it easy to operate .
this is the second one of these i have purchased .
this item works just as i thought it would .
i used this set with a toaster oven and with a coleman camping oven .
this is what s affordable right now , so it has to do .
i may even give some as gifts this holiday season .
i read all the reviews and decided on this one .
easy to put on and i have no problems .
fast; better than a blender and is easy to use .
saves on cleaning and the use of aluminum foil .
i have had mine for almost two years and they have not frayed .
no battery to wear out and have to replace .
wrapped around me easily to tuck in for getting ready at the gym .
i wouldn t trade them but this is a great knife for the price .
no problems with this and worked with many devices .
i received them as a christmas present and i love them .
you have to break it in , in other words .
and it ll keep rice perfect and hot for up to num_num hours .
i do seem to need to invest in some better popcorn .
i have had no problem with either piece and highly recommend the products .
one great feature is that the spatula head is removable for east cleaning .
get it , it s worth the price for sure .
this style of meat pounder is sort of commodity like .
fits perfectly , cutouts are <UNK> where they should be .
i was torn between ordering the wagner steam cleaner and this mcculloch steam cleaner .
i just received a replacement bb curve from verizon .
it works with all types , but works best with roma tomatoes .
the flap also is good and does not come loose at all .
the tiny green light on one side is very bright when fully charged .
take the whole thing out in the sink .
i bought this to grind xylitol and truvia sweeteners into a powder for cooking .
we use a bread machine to prepare the dough and provide the first rise .
the instructions came over the motorola num_extend and were very clear .
most pizza wheels that i ve seen are much smaller .
i guess you could say so what it s a ladle .
hand graters can be a mess to clean , especially under the handle .
went looking for them and you had them .
i have been using one for nearly num_num years .
also cheaper than going to the grocery store .
and yet it is compact and not too heavy .
this pan is a bit heavier and truly nonstick .
in particular , the coating on this cookware has been cheapened .
delicious over fruit and <UNK> go lean crunch cereal .
this is one of the best vacuums i ve ever come across .
i used a blade grinder for years before buying a burr grinder .
another thing i really like is that it does not have rivets .
the case zipper shuts with a flap that covers the zipped part .
i m a male , a bachelor who lives alone .
apparently there are thirteen more words required to successfully submit this review .
for the price , this is a good buy .
toasts bread , muffins and bagels with lots of options to choose .
the only thing is it stretches easily so be careful with that .
this happened after about num_num years of use .
i have had two of these cans outside for over a year .
perfect size for preparing dishes . it really works well .
i only wish the vacuum head was a little larger .
it s also a good size for a family of num_extend
