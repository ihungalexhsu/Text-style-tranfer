this is one that the quality was just as sweet as the quantity .
will work well with cheese ball and crackers or small slices of pound cake , etc .
riedel is one of the tests that is easy for even beginning drinkers to see the difference in .
i don t see how you can beat that .

i have three teenage boys who eat a lot and we tend to cook large meals .
this charger works well considering it is not an actually apple product .
it also will tell you when you have turned it off .

the back plate offers great protection and new charging options .
this is probably the best bb for the money .
ok , i m with everybody when it comes to this tray .

everyone recommends this knife , so no one will read this comment .
preheat the press with hot water while getting coffee ground and heating water .
all the rest is good . the phone is terrific as a phone .
the wide top reduces and concentrates flavors amazingly fast .
if you prefer <UNK> , cut them in half or even quarters .
very happy with this new addition to my kitchen .
if you want a fun way to protect your phone , this is the way .
i was familiar with corelle already so i knew they would never break or chip .
they are fabulous and <UNK> if you are a cook .
i do have a few scratches on the protector screen , but that s what its there for .
so when i saw this num_num on sale , i thought i was upgrading .
once that s been taken care of though , this thing really cooks .
it is beautiful with a smooth , shiny finish .
if you make big batches , get a big cuisinart .
i bought this otterbox case because the defender is too bulky .
either they do not fit properly , or they do not last .
for normal phone tasks , the boxwave works great .
while i own a ceramic sharpening device , i still haven t had to use it on either knife .
it was very helpful to have the number of cups needed for each pan plainly described on the packaging .
i am going to try and interrupt the cycle to make pizza dough .
after that i gave the slicer another chance .
it is secure enough that i could probably go jogging with it and not fall out .
bought one for myself , then had to buy a second one because my girlfriend stole my first .
of course , you ll probably figure that out for yourself .
it can charge a usb device while charging your phone .
i love the look of this charger first off .
i was so happy i bought the regular jar sealer also .
practical and ingenious , we use it all the time .
they give you everything you need and its worth the price although the iphone shield prices are pretty good .
brita makes a great product , and the price on amazon makes it worth buying here .
i m glad when i did , i chose a boos .
i put any delicate items that need to be washed .
i recommend them to anyone needing great value for the money .
all of my other tongs don t hold the food as well .
i got one of these batteries from oem planet via the amazon . com marketplace .
it is protective too ! when mine wears out if it does i will buy another ! .
it looks as good as it did when i first got it .
does exactly what you would expect it to do .
love it ! we ve used it to grind from french press to cappuccino , without a hitch .
i am very hard on my dishes and have been using corelle for years because of it .
i don t own much expensive cookware , although i wish i could afford it .
otherwise this works amazingly well in a variety of different sized pots .
i hang the from a hook in the kitchen .
the outside chrome part , does get very hot .
it does not rotate in every direction like the comparably priced starbucks machine .
however , it over heats if i use it to long without a break .
love all the color cases for such a cheap price .
the sound is alright but they are good because they block outside sounds .
the turkey fit nicely in the pan and came out very moist and flavorful .
it eliminates sediment and any traces of bitterness .
otherwise i can find no fault with the cup .
i own several timers and this is my favorite .
bought these to fight the glare from lights and being outside .
it also allows sending text messages through desktop when phone is connected .
he does not run or profusely sweat in these , so i cannot attest to the moisture durability .
you can use it to rest , <UNK> on it , too .
i was using a griffin unit that has buttons instead of motion sensing to control the iphone .
great cookware . you can keep a pot of chili or pasta sauce simmering without scorching for hours .
the <UNK> edges are smooth enough not to easily cut you .
cheaper then what s in the store , and seems to be working fine .
son has this on his nokia num_num and with use and abuse , this protective hard skin works perfectly .
i did and this was the closest to my old one .
love the quality stainless , as well as the long slender design .

it does have the cool v handle and i look forward to many years of use .
bought this for my mother when her old bunn coffee maker wouldn t quit leaking .
but i have other spatulas for when i need a straight edge .
the meat is only partially thawed when i slice it , but it works great .
i ve heard they are great with repairs if you need one .
the icarrier is another well built battery by them .
if you have a choice , i would definitely research shun and henckel .
the discount cards for places like cvs , walgreens , etc .
it is basically just a big luggage tag , but it does an adequate job .
they wash up easily , and the plastic container is perfect for storage .
have used filter pitchers and this is much easier to use .
this little brewer is much better for brewing my own coffee and easier to clean .
i cant believe how much hair and dust it picked up .
it is easy to use and fits the iphone num_num great .
the knife blades slide in and protects the blade .
this headset is exactly as described by the manufacturer .
charge performance is quick and handles all that i throw at it .
i really enjoy these with my wok cooking .
saves time , space and just plain awesome for those of us that can .
the num_num cup capacity has always been more than enough for my family of three as well .
the key number to pay attention to is the second one , the rated amperage .
upon switching to the iphone num_extend it has continued to work .
i love just looking at it , but i love it even more using it .
i have purchased other soup mugs , but this is the one for me .
so , it won t bother me when i work .
i have owned any number of strainers over the years , but never one like this .
these were ok , didn t like real small ones .
i have bought two additional ones for gifts and have had dozens more bought by my recommendation .
but , hey what do you expect for a num_num mah beast .
its a neck lanyard which is pretty standard .
is it the closest i found for fit , volume , clarity out and in etc ? absolutely .
it s not like real espresso , but it gets as close as you can for very little money .
however , i m told there is significant noise at highway speed .
it s much cheaper to buy your first items in a kit , rather than individually .
protects my phone and it s simple to put on and take off .
they work great drowning out all the noise while i am working out ! would buy them again .
it comes with a dough hook too even though i didn t see it in the description .
the lg optimus v part of the one series is an excellent starter phone for android .
unlike some people who use this water for only cooking purposes , i drink this water and love it .
but once in a while , a large skillet is called for , and this one is perfect .
i foresee the vacuum being released like the other reviewers mentioned .
the unit size is nice and there is room to fry a lot of potatoes .
i am tall so i do not have the problem some other reviewers have had of seeing the gauge .
this will be my second of these scrapers .
my num_extend fits perfectly with the protective skin on it .
the domed lid is perfect to keep things from splattering .
handles are actually a bit longer than the blade but that is the novelty .

i have gotten no complaints from people i call and am on the phone a lot .
guess it has been a while since i had used or needed a double boiler ? ! .
there are different types of burr grinders but the conical type is supposed to be the best .
is it a wonder why this coffee grinder is rated number num_extend
however , it is a bit difficult to clean .
it took num_num hours to bring it to full charge . the ipad num_num was at num_num percent capacity .
i have been frustrated with the treo num_extend because of its low quality external speaker .
i discover a filter above the dirt canister and it was clogged .
i love that i can take it from vehicle to vehicle with me .
after several drops the case has yet to come flying off as many of the hard cases do .
how i don t know . first i sent an email to sf planet via amazon . com .
i got the recommendation from cooks illustrated , and it works like a charm .
another plus is that it is reasonably light for its size .
when i look at its picture while ordering i never think it should be same as in the pics .
i love the blade <UNK> that s probably my favorite part about this .
i have used this while sitting in a deer stand charging num_num iphones .
i was pleasantly surprised when the product arrived and did indeed have a brushed finish .
the same goes for beef and pork roasts .
i use it mainly for preparing coffee beans for storage .
bought for use in making cocoa , french onion soup and to microwave without the handles getting hot .
this is an awesome product , if only in appearance .
i read a lot of reviews on this before i forked out the cash .
this cover fits it nicely and together they do make a statement of color .
just have to be patient in installing , also have really steady hands .
not a big deal , but much larger than i expected .
i do agree with the other statements about the container being a bit on the cheap side .
glass is thick and durable and fits nicely in the wire frame .
couldnt be that much harder to add it .
don t give this amazing tool a bad review just because you were sent a different model .
this is exactly the same as the one it replaced and works perfectly .
i love this ! i was a little upset that when i received it , it was broken .
i really loved it and will use it alot .
it fits all jars perfectly and cans well .
thanks to the seller for sending me a quality new product .
i live in an apartment and did not want the fire alarm going off .
who knew . . . . i followed both machine recipes for basic bread .
the blender does what a usual blender is supposed to do .
you need to balance size , cost and power .
we all can use one charger instead of having multiple chargers all over the place .
i use it when i clean the outside refrig .
two pulses in one direction and one or two in the other direction gets most of the jobs done .
and they make the phone easier to grip while protecting the surface .
this is very nice i had to register this handset .
this vornado heater is pure luxury to me .
these are the best forks i have ever found for crab legs .
the num_extend uses a regular sim so swapping this sim isn t possible without this adapter .
i expect to use these dishes for the rest of my life .
volume buttons are a little hard to get to but not to bad .
buy more than you think you need , you ll use em .
i changed my kitchen to white canister , coffee pot , etc .
normally i m partial to the oxo stuff , but this juice press is miles better .
this counter <UNK> is awesome and i have more counter room .
i cut up a ziploc bag and used it for the bottom and top and pressed another tortilla out .
considering the above , it s well worth this price .
if you use your fido jars a lot , you will eventually need a pack of these .
i owned the old version of this same brand and model which served me well for num_extend years .
for him , he gets a dessert , a veg , a salad and a main .
i bought this on amazon quite some time ago .
thanks so very much for an awesome case .
i changed screen protectors twice i believe in a matter of nearly a year .
i d recommend it for anyone that wants easy access to their credit cards and id .
this is the best blade grinder i have found .
the water is just as tasteless , but the flow is much better .
i use this vent mount with my samsung galaxy nexus and my ipod .
there are also belt loops but i have not used them yet .
at its current price of less than $ it s really a steal as well .
the discovery num_num seemed to fit the bill .
nice pan ! this pizza pan is a great size .
it heats fast and is very efficient in heating .
i like the dual plug in style on the charger that includes usb access .
having had cheaper large pots , i <UNK> away from buying this expensive pot .
this is a must have for anyone who has a cell phone .
they promptly responded that it was , and when the battery arrived , it was indeed a real motorola .
don t put in ear while crazy glue is wet .
sometimes i have to keep mobile in dusty places .
five days a week we use the beeps as our alarm clock .
what were they thinking ? so glad i could still find the digital display foreman .
i wasn t expecting much because <UNK> was so low .
the numbers on each are etched solidly into the rubber <UNK> , ensuring they won t disappear anytime soon .
they gave me a week to see if any more problems popped up .
just wanted to say i was pleasantly surprised when i received this today .
you can also rotate it to fit it in your left or right ear .
i am using a rooted and modded inspire num_extend
i needed a set with a <UNK> accent to go with my gold rimmed plates .
makes a good cup of coffee and does it reasonably quickly .
well worth the money , and perhaps nail polish could replace the markings that wear off ? .
it works perfectly ! i m very happy with the price , the product and how quickly it arrived .
never have found anything as good at this as these bamboo brushes . . . ! .
the incredible was a great phone for the most part but it ate through battery .
does require a bit of guess work , but still not difficult .
having the right tools makes any task easier .

probably should not have purchased as fried foods are not good for you but they taste good .
i gave it num_num stars because i had to return the first on .

like i said , it is not really steam .
each glass size ended being exactly what i like .
now my phone will last for a while when i am traveling .
i had to season the press , but that was easy .
this is good since you would have to convert your own recipes to the above proportions .
and the retractable cord is also a very nice feature .
my old charger s cable was flimsy and it stopped working right when bent in a certain position .
however , the baker in the family will want a nice clean silpat for her christmas cookies .
i purchased these form amazon in num_num and we are still using them on a daily basis .
this little tool is perfect and can t understand why i never invested in one before .

coffee had to change the design of the tea maker and the new pitchers are <UNK> .
but since i got this one , it s the only one i use .
with the glass lid i can see if the liquid is all absorbed with out letting the steam out .
over num_num years ago i used a pressure cooker on a regular basis .
it is so convenient we ll live with that issue .
you just have to make sure you pack down the grounds lightly before brewing .
but , i would not suggest blending anything hard like ice in a canning jar .
i must say that i love every one of them .
perfect , well build and also perfectly fit all kinds of <UNK> .
this is a fine mug for teachers , business people etc .
this is great to have on hand and a fun thing to do with kids or grandchildren .
easy <UNK> , just slip your finger in and it slices through the peel .
as far as the filters on all the brands , they are basically charcoal based .
yes it s a pain , but this is what s necessary when you must always be connected .

the footprint is almost as big as the processor , but it easily fits in the cabinet .
the juice tastes delicious and the consistency is smooth with a perfect amount of juicy foam at the top .
but the thing is , i don t think they should bend .
the only thing better would have been getting a new mixer .
the <UNK> chain relieves strain from the earbuds and can be hidden discreetly under your shirt .
they have been dropped , dented and scratched and still they continue to be my favorite bowls .
that stand is locked in there quite well .
this cord has been put through the <UNK> with my iphone num_num and it still works num_extend years later .
i bought it because it is the meat pounder alton brown recommended .
as a former commercial meat cutter i ve had years of experience with this type product .

there is a size or two up that i like the best from oxo however .
i like being able to attach it to my belt or just hang it on my pants pocket .
the handle is shorter than my regular pans , and the handle can get very hot during cooking .
worth buying a few or more to have in the car , briefcase , house and whatnot .

this one was at a great price and it works well .
i ve used these numerous times , and have issues only because i m kinda tough on a phone .

he tells me it is by far the best one he has ever used .
the first is a two piece hard shell that snaps around the ipod .
and they were all <UNK> made and they could not afford a real good made one .
practice with it a bit though , it can splash out if you have an odd shaped bottle .

i m hoping we have many years of trouble free use with this machine .
this phone is really cool and i recommend it for anyone looking for a bad ass phone .
it has never failed to open what i needed opened .
a finer grind coffee will give you major flavor without having to use so much i found .

the disposal cup is large enough and easy to empty and reinstall on the vacuum .

this one is , but it ll wear away the nonstick properties faster , so handwashing is recommended .
this is a plastic <UNK> and the pieces dont install well .
i moved into the <UNK> where the water is so much better .
thanks amazon and the manufacturer for good packing and quick shipping .

i originally got this product because i wanted a stylus for my ipad to mark up documents .
i bought this as my wife has developed a taste for guacamole dip .
i am a first time user so am not an expert .

the background noise cancellation on this thing is the top of the line .
it grinds grains without making too much noise .
