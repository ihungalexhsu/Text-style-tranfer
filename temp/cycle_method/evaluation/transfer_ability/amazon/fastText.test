__label__1 great dutch oven , works well and fun to use on camping trips .
__label__1 the otterbox defender series is by far the best available .
__label__1 this turner has worked well for the last few years .
__label__1 but i like the phone to be up higher on the windshield . recommended .
__label__1 heavy , patterned glass , and very classy looking on the table .
__label__1 i have not been able to stop using it .
__label__1 however , slicing up tons of veggies can be quite time consuming .
__label__1 i mainly use my <UNK> now but haven t sold the vitamix yet .
__label__1 i was glad to see it was still available .
__label__1 very easy to put on , no bubbles whatsoever .
__label__1 i can see i will be using it a lot .
__label__1 i was concerned for the price that these measuring cups would be flimsy .

__label__1 i bought the lowest priced model more to test the brand than anything else .

__label__1 i will never have a phone without an otterbox again .
__label__1 then i thought something was wrong with my car .
__label__1 that is sufficiently minor as to not affect my rating .
__label__1 because it s made of cast iron , scorching is minimized .
__label__1 i imagine it will make soups even better than the old one as well .
__label__1 very nice unit , easy to assemble and operate .
__label__1 simple ! does the job it was intended for .
__label__1 i ve been using this for months , and like it very much .

__label__1 i really like how this counter protector curves over the edge of the counter .

__label__1 it is not difficult to clean or assemble .
__label__1 this pan is a bit heavier and truly nonstick .
__label__1 i can hear the caller clearly , vice versa .

__label__1 anker is a fine product though i d never heard of it .
__label__1 the unit itself rests like a necklace around your neck .
__label__1 the item was what i was looking for and arrived exactly as described .

__label__1 i bought three of these units to place in our home .
__label__1 and that would be what you would need .
__label__1 it works fine and the coffee is just as great ! .
__label__1 it basically picks up what is directly in front of it .
__label__1 pretty much all i ask for in a grinder .
__label__1 it s a very good quality at a <UNK> price .
__label__1 just do your homework and you will end up pretty satisfied .
__label__1 this knife sharpener more than met our expectations .
__label__1 most pizza wheels that i ve seen are much smaller .
__label__1 perfect fit for replacement in my num_num year old blender that still works .
__label__1 and i have tried a lot of them .
__label__1 i give it five stars for making eating good so easy ! .
__label__1 i can t believe how strong this little guy is .
__label__1 the daily challenge around here is keeping the cat fur to a minimum .

__label__1 fair price . x x x x x x x x xx x .
__label__1 i have to say that it was money well spent .
__label__1 it stores in a really small place and is built to last .
__label__1 saves on cleaning and the use of aluminum foil .
__label__1 what a change in my life this will make .
__label__1 the sound is also very surprising for the price and is enough for me .
__label__1 this is the second one of these i have purchased .
__label__1 it doesn t require genius to get this unit operating .
__label__1 i estimate that four trips were made to empty and refill the water compartments .

__label__1 the instructions came over the motorola num_extend and were very clear .
__label__1 once the lid closes , the smell goes away .

__label__1 still it is a fun learning experience and so far so good .
__label__1 it was just what i expected it to be .
__label__1 i did not have what i felt were unrealistic expectations of this device .

__label__1 of course the german s call this sort of idea good engineering .
__label__1 i also love that this griddle doubles as an indoor grill .
__label__1 we have used ours at least a couple of hundred times .
__label__1 a must have if you have one of the older <UNK> .
__label__1 i may even give some as gifts this holiday season .
__label__1 the finer the setting , the longer it takes .
__label__1 i use these reviews so heavily that i want to give back .
__label__1 should have a wider design for different foods .
__label__1 its actually a little better than the filter that came with the unit .
__label__1 purchased this to charge my new android tablet in the car on trips .
__label__1 i ve had to repair it a few times as it s % plastic .
__label__1 this is the best cookware i ve ever owned .
__label__1 not that anything sticks that much you just don t have to worry .
__label__0 if your bike had a kickstand on the plate it won t lock down .
__label__0 they are thinner and retain memory than the older ones .
__label__0 it makes a buzzing sound when devices are plugged in .
__label__0 i could barely get through it they taste so nasty .
__label__0 either than or the developers decided to do their own .
__label__0 the pair made in mexico is much better .
__label__0 i m selling mine to make room for something else .
__label__0 it looks like i ve splashed glitter all over my face .
__label__0 went to the second one using the same method , no go .
__label__0 it was not as good as our much cheaper model .
__label__0 so not that great for leaving on at night .
__label__0 when i contacted the company the response was that they shipped it .
__label__0 and , there were many things we liked about this game .
__label__0 ridiculous ! i had trouble getting it on with zero bubbles .
__label__0 i ve been through so many of these ineffective silly things .
__label__0 after a few days i noticed i was unusually fatigued .
__label__0 the jawbone may perform admirably as far as technology .
__label__0 did nt have time to return it before christmas so bought another <UNK> .
__label__0 another num_num calories from the other num_num grams of carbohydrates .
__label__0 these are supposedly cotton , but they don t feel like it .
__label__0 one major complaint is the <UNK> of collecting shards .
__label__0 i tried <UNK> the magnets back on to no avail .
__label__0 no comment on the strainer since i have not used it yet .
__label__0 overall we will not be purchasing this product again .
__label__0 <UNK> purchased this item from a major retailer about num_num years ago .
__label__0 i received the wrong color and it shreds easily .
__label__0 i will never buy hamilton beach products again .
__label__0 the description on the website did not state that the straps were elastic .
__label__0 we re too stupid to put together normal sounding sentences .
__label__0 the box is very shallow and not easily covered securely .
__label__0 this is not worth the money and the brand name is misleading .
__label__0 the cars that come with this garage are cute .
__label__0 spyro games always used to be fun , but that tradition ends here .
__label__0 the computer recognized the usb connection , but the cursor never moved .
__label__0 so i bought this product hoping it would help to regulate my cycles .
__label__0 i would not even give my current one away .
__label__0 we have been treating our hair for months and finally got this .
__label__0 i bought this set for our toaster oven .
__label__0 is that what you re looking for ? go elsewhere .
__label__0 not that we should of had to do that .
__label__0 my mouth feels very dry and i am thirsty after drinking this .
__label__0 my cat just isn t at all interested in these springs .
__label__0 obviously we all have our own preferences for taste .
__label__0 since that time i have replaced the game .
__label__0 surely not worth what was paid for it by half .
__label__0 once you play one match , you ve played them all .
__label__0 i m just looking forward to the day i get to replace it .
__label__0 i like neutrogena products as a rule , so this was a disappointment .
__label__0 the original unreal tournament is the very definition of fun .
__label__0 the first time through , things really slowed down around level num_extend
__label__0 two reviewers determined there are drivers to be downloaded but i was unsuccessful .
__label__0 the bar contains agave nectar which does not occur naturally .
__label__0 i couldn t stand the persistent smell of feces in my apartment .
__label__0 first , i put them both under my tongue simultaneously .
__label__0 not a good product for conditioning even though it says it has shea butter .
__label__0 i would never recommend this terrible waste of money case .
__label__0 i ve used it twice and it has stopped working .
__label__0 i run it outside the window and connect it to a garden hose .
__label__0 can t imagine how it acts when you heat style your hair .
__label__0 because it s too big for my cup holder .
__label__0 amazon was good to give me a refund right away .
__label__0 it crashed for no reason , saves got corrupted .
__label__0 i bought this toy for my boys a few years back .
__label__0 if you are sensitive to maltodextrin , this isn t for you .
__label__0 then contact sharp and go on from there .
__label__0 we ve tried num_num of these waffle makers since jan num_extend
__label__0 i ll stick to my xbox for now , thanks .
__label__0 i ve used these a few times and broke them very easily .
__label__0 this one sits on our shelf collecting dust .
__label__0 two days later i no longer saw them anywhere on the building .
__label__0 i hate myself for falling for the james bond license and wasting $
__label__0 don t buy this unless you like replacing toasters .
__label__0 this cream will give you acne if you have sensitive skin .
__label__0 i would not buy anything else from this vendor .
__label__0 i could feel some of the grains even after much shaking .
__label__0 and after all that , the base broke too .
__label__0 the aftertaste is so overpowering i had to brush my teeth .
__label__0 i am actually afraid to open the remaining jars .
__label__0 the charging light illuminates , but does not charge .
__label__0 the product is not durable but it might just be the one i received .
__label__0 then she said well you ordered the pu which is what you got .
__label__0 i didn t have the rust problems that others had .
__label__0 in that short time , he ripped one wing off the toy .
__label__0 this item does not provide full coverage as the picture suggests .
__label__0 these definitely open up your nasal passages and functionally work as advertised .
__label__0 this is a fantastic idea , however it has some flaws .
__label__0 if you can afford it step up to something that will last .
__label__0 i won t be buying from this vender ever again .
__label__0 i thought the concept was good; <UNK> thinks otherwise .
__label__0 every product i own from them has failed or been a letdown .
__label__0 i would not trust anything bigger than iphone num_extend
__label__0 i have a made in usa version of this .
__label__0 then i put the cream on my feet especially around my toes and heels .
__label__0 you can go to any chain store and do better .
__label__0 i simply treated it how i would assume a curling iron works .
__label__0 also the free will option is an absolute joke .
__label__0 if you are stir frying your ingredients i . e .
__label__0 of course in most sports games , graphics shouldn t matter .
__label__0 i had it professionally installed at a local bike shop .
__label__0 this ring looked beautiful on out of the box .
__label__0 i did some research , and went with this one .
__label__0 i figured this would be a great alternative to use during the six weeks .
__label__0 i bought this for my num_num month old from santa for christmas .
__label__0 we purchased this so our daughter could have fun toy to play with .
__label__0 please reply with the filter part number and your location .
__label__0 i woke up with basically an oil slick on my face .
__label__0 i put it together to surprise my husband .
__label__0 it hasn t done anything for his thin coat though .
__label__0 they send you num_num because each one lasts about two days .
__label__0 i felt i must have missed something if the reviews were so good .
__label__0 i have to lower the rating another notch .
__label__0 i have purchased fairly cheap holders from motorola and they lasted a while .
__label__0 i was surprised as the box seemed to be in good shape .
__label__0 i was looking forward to this game for a couple of num_extend
__label__0 these run quite small even though they are stretchy .
__label__0 i think i will return and stick with wool gloves .
__label__0 like <UNK> : legends of wrestling , it has too many glitches to count .
__label__0 if you have soft facial fair then by all means use these razors .
__label__0 she handed it back to me and picked up her ginsu knife .
__label__0 got all excited , but this taste <UNK> like honey at all .
__label__0 it scrolls way too easily and way too smoothly .
__label__0 a little at first , more with each successive try .
__label__0 i had to get some from the phone store .
__label__0 you can probably run them over with your car and still be okay .
__label__0 the wheel <UNK> stuck and wont turn on its rail .
__label__0 most operations there is a noticable delay lag of num_extend to num_num seconds .
__label__0 there was nothing at all to indicate that belkin manufactured this item .
__label__0 my little girl wanted this for her birthday , so we got it .
__label__0 this meter is technology from a decade ago .
__label__0 i do not like this belt because of lack of material .
__label__0 too small and not the quality i expected .
__label__0 it just smears it around until the water evaporates into the air .
__label__0 i purchased this based on rave reviews from others .
__label__0 i guess maybe there are some people that this product could help .
__label__0 with sliced cheese in lieu of french bread on a fruit and cheese plate .
__label__0 it didn t have the smell a lot complained of though .
__label__0 i have been using it twice a day since i received it .
__label__0 i put in a password but router won t <UNK> it .
__label__0 worse , the controls are so confusing that it gives me a headache .
__label__0 now i have a game that i don t ever want to play .
__label__0 nokia knows how to design a very good interface .
__label__0 basically , this product is a ripoff on consumers .
__label__0 this is honestly the only case i ve thrown away in the garbage .
__label__0 i ve had many lighters and this one might be the best .
__label__0 its good that its made in canada rather than china .
__label__0 this machine is no match for the new consoles .
__label__0 i contacted the company and they said that the shipment had been lost .
__label__0 it s the lame players that drives halo <UNK> into the ground .
__label__0 good for one day only . and opi test this product on animals .
__label__0 first of all , syrup shouldn t run , it should ooze .
__label__0 also it gets very hot while plugged in , which freaked me out .
__label__0 returned product but from what i ve heard it does the job .
__label__0 drinking the coffee was slightly less <UNK> than the smell suggested it would be .
__label__0 it is worse then no lube because it gets soooo sticky .
__label__0 birds or squirrels . tried num_num different kinds of bird food .
__label__0 however , definitely does not work like a new battery .
__label__0 what a ripoff ! learn from my mistake , do not buy .
__label__0 and still the focus was extremely soft or just plain terrible .
__label__0 i also tried a cheaper brand of slip on rubber broad heads .
__label__0 other brands in this large of a container are glass .
__label__0 yes , they are light , and are not durable at all .
__label__0 she could have decorated her carrying case herself .
__label__0 there are companies that make dog biscuits with the activated charcoal in it .
__label__0 i ve learned that companies make varying degrees of quality .
__label__0 thought , hey why not try something different might work .
__label__0 audio isn t a religion and these are not holy water .
__label__0 the real thing is nong shim shin noodle <UNK> .
__label__0 this just doesn t have enough power to massage my shoulders and neck .
__label__0 with a couple of bucks you could make something a lot better yourself .
__label__0 i had much better luck with the other three pairs mentioned .
__label__0 it s like i got an extension cord and male outlets on both ends .
__label__0 the bowl is too light we even had it on a rubber mat .
__label__0 will break in over time though , it s rubber .
__label__0 it is so small . get a racket ball . pass this one by .
__label__0 that is not to say that these treats are bad by any means .
__label__0 the buttons to extend the arms worked exactly one time before breaking .
__label__0 i m sure it depends on your age and body type .
__label__0 the transmit strength on this compact num_extend is pretty strong .
__label__0 generally if a toy makes noise , i don t mind so much .
__label__0 there was almost nothing i liked about this product .
__label__0 i used the product for five days straight before running out .
__label__0 so i guess it s really a matter of preference .
__label__0 first of all , this will void whatever warranty you have with microsoft .
__label__0 and it is very possible that these are good cables .
__label__0 the bottom part is stretching after only a month of owning the case .
__label__0 but it didn t do anything for my face .
__label__0 i got this for my num_num month old daughter for christmas .
__label__0 they pee in it about once a week , if that .
__label__0 i only ordered on here because they were alot cheaper .
__label__0 insert the micro usb to your phone and enjoy your widescreen display .
__label__0 to <UNK> credit , this game was a bit fun .
__label__0 i say this as a guy with fairly thin wrists too .
__label__0 trying to slide to a different screen instantly turns it back off .
__label__0 it not educational or exciting and it s annoying .
__label__0 i spent $ for the num_extend and overall it was not worth the cost .
__label__0 im thinking num_num gem stones in at least a num_num inch wheel .
__label__0 i can use a creamy concealer on it .
__label__0 shame on what otherwise has been a reliable company with several other <UNK> products .
__label__0 my husband said it was obvious so i had to return it .
__label__0 speedloader is very hard to use especially with an extended magazine .
__label__0 mind you the oem xoom charger is not like that at all .
__label__0 for the price tag , its nothing to rave about .
__label__0 i mean she felt apart she <UNK> down in a hundred pieces .
__label__0 i had to buy one out on the road .
__label__0 this particular variety is rather lacking in the flavor department .
__label__0 i m tired of cheaply made , high priced appliances .
__label__0 i won t give this to the new puppy i m getting .
__label__0 i bought this skillet for steaks and fried potatoes , and fried eggs .
__label__0 note that i got mine from an amazon store called small appliance .
__label__0 i practically felt like i threw away my money on this one .
__label__0 maybe it just needs broken in and some fine fitting .
__label__0 after four days of that , i gave up and chucked it .
__label__0 in num_num thq came out with this wrestling game .
__label__0 i didn t have enough of them to return .
__label__0 i cannot recommend this product for anyone trying to fix a leaky transmission .
__label__0 for me this was a most disappointing product .
__label__0 this is just a little too low quality .
__label__0 the lid is the best part of the pot ensemble .
__label__0 this is due to the short lived cheaper lasers they put in them .
__label__0 whatever the case , i couldn t be more unhappy with this purchase .
__label__0 these make great little night lights for the kids .
__label__0 i ve not had this happen with my wusthofs .
__label__0 first , there is nothing about this to really write home about .
__label__0 the item was considerably different quality than pictured .
__label__0 $ is too much to pay for a $ cable .
__label__0 hopefully you won t have to go through this nonsense .
__label__0 i agree with the others that this was tough to open .
__label__0 i must find a way to return them .
__label__0 does increase volume but does not feel nice to the touch .
__label__0 i don t see what others have liked about this .
__label__0 i have no idea why this is a cult favorite .
__label__0 it makes an annoying sound when it is on .
__label__0 me too is a nice brand and make very comfortable shoes .
__label__0 with this i say i work giving support to the u . s .
__label__0 first things first , make sure you are ordering the right headset .
__label__0 this game offers nothing unique and the graphics are not worth raving about .
__label__0 another energy product that simply wastes our money .
__label__0 very well designed and easy to figure out .
__label__0 this game gives you no incentive to keep playing .
__label__0 i thought this was the hard plastic screen cover and it isn t .
__label__0 would suggest using one of the toy <UNK> amazon sells .
__label__0 plus , it s not very filling , even for rice .
__label__0 i ve used it once and i won t be using it again .
__label__0 the cables seem rather basic and work well , except one problem .
__label__0 this cord seemed like a deal and got good reviews .
__label__0 that does not hold true for this product .
__label__0 i had high hopes for this product since i bruise easily .
__label__0 this is called cheating ! i expected canister with fuel at least .
__label__0 the inside of the case that contacts the phone is not smooth at all .
__label__0 it opens cans ok , but no better than the old fashioned openers .
__label__0 i d rather be a little less healthy and a little more happy .
__label__0 try explaining to a two year old why her tattoo keeps breaking .
__label__0 the kids thought it was great , but it got old pretty quick .
__label__0 this did not stop odor and my pets wanted to eat it .
__label__0 marineland does a very good job with their led aquarium systems .
__label__0 once the charger is removed , the phone starts working , again .
__label__0 and theres no warning on any of these cans that i can identify .
__label__0 like they glued it together and shipped it out it seemed .
__label__0 i did not purchase my set from this vendor .
__label__0 they are cheerios , afterall , and we love the original kind .
__label__0 it makes a <UNK> out of a good num_num num_extend
__label__0 it could be that i live in an apartment with hills and trees around .
__label__0 i miss my days of cracker eating before becoming gluten free .
__label__0 both rub my dog raw and cause bleeding .
__label__0 do not buy . i didn t expect much because of the cost .
__label__0 i did not buy from a num_extend party seller .
__label__0 while the mascara is soft , it is not full .
__label__0 i ordered two of them and both arrived within a week .
__label__0 also , it creates more static than the one i m used to .
__label__0 overall it is inconvenient to keep the counter and the unit clean .
__label__0 it s this second part that really <UNK> me out .
__label__0 because these knives will greatly appreciate on the collector s market .
__label__0 gave it to someone named happy on her birthday .
__label__0 just spend the extra bucks and buy an official one from apple .
__label__0 absolutely <UNK> cheaper @ costco if you must .
__label__0 it took three years three vets and over twelve hundred dollars spent before success .
__label__0 my first draft of this review was also way too long .
__label__0 all the songs build on the same words .
__label__0 hasn t had to be rebooted yet due to connection issues .
__label__0 i kept it though i do not use it .
__label__0 the concept was great and it worked very well when it worked .
__label__0 the did not a <UNK> water at all .
__label__0 i adjusted the volumes on the ipod and the cassette player .
__label__0 i was not at all pleased with the performance of this chopper .
__label__0 i have no padding of my own to offset hard soles .
__label__0 and i wanted them all to be easy to access .
__label__0 this is a good hoodie and well made .
__label__0 it s very black , and it does add volume .
__label__0 cheap , low quality <UNK> scope with even cheaper ring mounts .
__label__0 first of all i m not some raging halo .
__label__0 i started using <UNK> nasal spray a few years ago .
__label__0 first , and surprising was that they have removeable sole inserts .
__label__0 however , i feel civilization iv is most definitely not an improvement overall .
__label__0 avoid the heartache and wasted <UNK> of bad discs .
__label__0 but this stuff will fall apart after only a few washings .
__label__0 company will exchange though but it wastes your time doing this .
__label__0 lasted for two games , during which i was the sole operator .
__label__0 very hard plastic and not that fun to play with at all .
__label__0 save yourself some time and money and skip this product .
__label__0 a process that takes a couple of minutes .
__label__0 i love cheetos and any artificially or naturally enhanced cheese snack .
__label__0 hardly something i would give as a wrapped birthday gift .
__label__0 the problem with the acrylic ones i ve found is the tipping factor .
__label__0 bought this for use to hold my droid incredible .
__label__0 that is right up until one day the record feature stopped working .
__label__0 my daughter used this for school for about num_num months until the strap broke .
__label__0 i have num_num bird feeders hanging from poles in my front and back yard .
__label__0 spent more time fiddling with this than i did looking at the road .
__label__0 don t waste your time or money on these jeans .
__label__0 i first used it on my hands and fingers .
__label__0 i also have to hold the headphone cord to keep it from flapping around .
__label__0 not the fastest but better than my other hot air brush .
__label__0 i threw it out because i can t take alcohol .
__label__0 after that you have to pay a subscription .
__label__0 there s no way this will last as long as claimed .
__label__0 i will still continue to use philosophy products , just not this one .
__label__0 certainly one of the more widely produced in the us .
__label__0 just reinstall the previous ghost recon and <UNK> shield games .
__label__0 all of them are utter garbage , not even decent polyester .
__label__0 i d suggest anyone looking to purchase linksys products look into netgear instead .
__label__0 good thing filters for num_num gallon tanks are cheap .
__label__0 i might return it , but i need a can opener .
__label__0 instead i would recommend cetaphil gentle cleanser and you will be fine .
__label__0 sugar is extremely addictive and does absolutely nothing for your body .
__label__0 i d rather tie a towel around my neck as a cape .
__label__0 the <UNK> on my dog caused him to sit .
__label__0 the case fit okay but not attractive at all .
__label__0 as i get hit , my health endurance goes down .
__label__0 they would flip off or get hung up due to poorly rolling wheels .
__label__0 one thing is the amazingly poor unit a . i .
__label__0 i expected an improvement in signal strength from my tiny usb direct plugin type .
__label__0 my first suggestion to anyone reading reviews on this product is to keep looking .
__label__0 for some reason it worked out terribly for me .
__label__0 amazon does not provide enough information about this press .
__label__0 multiplayer is just as bad , though thankfully not worse .
__label__0 i was bored after the first num_num minutes .
__label__0 i loved the food for my cats as you can read below .
__label__0 th product features and editorial review spell germany as the origin of manufacture .
__label__0 it didn t work for me hopefully other people will have better luck .
__label__0 flavor : it has some tangy notes , and overall not bad .
__label__0 mine is a piece of junk , as far as i am concerned .
__label__0 would have been alot nicer if it simply threaded in with the correct alignment .
__label__0 it is best to invest in a good set of makeup brushes .
__label__0 i am only giving this item num_num stars because of the absurd price .
__label__0 this does not appear to attract more mosquitos than the light does by itself .
__label__0 it almost fit , but not enough to snap completely together and fit .
__label__0 there is no menu selection for find free books .
__label__0 i will always have slight pain , no matter what .
__label__0 the material that it is made of is like a dirt magnet .
__label__0 it works for maybe a few minutes and wears off quickly .
__label__0 the directions were easy to follow but the quality of the easel was pathetic .
__label__0 waste of money , waste of time , waste of blood .
__label__0 this case is far from what i expected .
__label__0 too bulky and there are better products out there in single units .
__label__0 does not give me any confidence in buying any of the discovery kids toys .
__label__0 i would suggest a more tropical flavor with chilled water .
__label__0 old grandson loves all things that have to do with construction .
__label__0 maybe a num_extend old girl could wear it .
__label__0 so please stop buying this and maybe they will lower the price .
__label__0 soe decided to push it to live a whole num_num weeks sooner than that .
__label__0 it s not overpowering , it is not like perfume .
__label__0 num_extend has much better graphics , better sound , slightly better control .
__label__0 also the headphones do not feel comfortable on your head .
__label__0 <UNK> used to be the best thing around .
__label__0 it really is like they didn t take anything at all .
__label__0 i tried everything short of breaking the thing open .
__label__0 other reviews seemed more positive , but i just gave mine away .
__label__0 i dumped all num_num screen protectors in the trash bin .
__label__0 does this ever happen to the cpu ? rarely .
__label__0 i would not buy this again in the future .
__label__0 crayola makes the best crayons , don t get me wrong .
__label__0 perhaps it won t rust , but <UNK> it looks a little cheesey .
__label__0 so i just thought maybe it ll help keep my acne away .
__label__0 its <UNK> but thats not the best thing to say about headphones .
__label__0 my dog has started to become anxious at bedtime .
__label__0 so after two months of use , working in it .
__label__0 i don t know why it has all the good reviews .
__label__0 there were other vegetables included , but you really couldn t taste them .
__label__0 the quality of materials and workmanship is noticeably less .
__label__0 i used this along with another similar product , for over num_num months .
__label__0 i don t think the saying you get what you pay .
__label__0 if you want a cheaper sub deal with companies that <UNK> in that category .
__label__0 enfamil infant is characterized by choline and dha .
__label__0 you dont get so much sand with this .
__label__0 if you get these just be a bit careful .
__label__0 it reminds me more of silly putty than of a concealer .
__label__0 it worked for maybe num_num months then died .
__label__0 this is not at all expected from a respected brand like sony .
__label__0 my goof to not research this brand more .
__label__0 i found these patches very hard to put on .
__label__0 i ve not been terribly impressed with this box .
__label__0 i will add an update if i ever figure it out .
__label__0 i tried hiding them in her food and in her treats .
__label__0 she didn t like the handle of this one at all .
__label__0 well it made it worse like a rubber band texture .
__label__0 i ll just stick with a good mayo and skip the bacon .
__label__0 thank heaven the operation is intuitive because there are no instructions .
__label__0 i thought i was over charged once it was returned .
__label__0 i bought them and find them pretty annoying .
__label__0 after all the great reviews i thought i d give this a try .
__label__0 unfortunately this product did not do much for me .
__label__0 you get what you pay for i guess .
__label__0 it might work for all purpose flour , which has less gluten .
__label__0 in my experience , they are a constant source of problems .
__label__0 disappointed as i expected to received candy that would last a long time .
__label__0 the waist cords are over a foot long after being taken in .
__label__0 so , this car looks cool and all but its not that great .
__label__0 i have no idea if it s me or this product doing .
__label__0 otherwise , they fall off your head at the slightest lean or tilt .
__label__0 just hurry up and play the darn song and move on for goodness sake .
__label__0 try it once and you won t think it s stupid .
__label__0 it was supposed to be a complete toy .
__label__0 nevertheless , the smell lasts for num_num or num_num minutes tops .
__label__0 good that they are from usa and not china ! .
__label__0 so far i am not at all happy .
__label__0 i purchased them and when they arrived they were torn .
__label__0 quite tasteless and they make you order so many .
__label__0 camera fell of it after a few uses .
__label__0 i will never again purchase another game where this is a requirement .
__label__0 really , it all does look nice graphically wise .
__label__0 its very similar to that type of style .
__label__0 might have been nice , but just went over my cheeks .
__label__0 the shape of the grains makes all the difference .
__label__0 first , without the extension they are very short .
__label__0 i then emptied th coffee grinder and looked for an obstruction , none .
__label__0 they have a medium pile lining that has more of a stiffer polyester feel .
__label__0 <UNK> s friendship is cool too where he <UNK> his <UNK> .
__label__0 it s too bad because they look like they would keep my ears warm .
__label__0 these <UNK> are in water not vegetable oil .
__label__0 when you place the eye brow attachment on you can get a mixed cut .
__label__0 i won t be buying any more in the future .
__label__0 i hated the color that was sent to me , pale chalky beige .
__label__0 that s not what it felt like with the original gel adhesive .
__label__0 the <UNK> <UNK> num_num inch dock extender works only part way .
__label__0 because it is definitely not worth full price .
__label__0 i would not recommend this item for dogs who chew .
__label__0 this is the worst game i have come across in a long time .
__label__0 unfortunately i m not sure what all the five star reviews are for .
__label__0 it is too bad because the ingredients looked to be quality .
__label__0 i wore this product today for a few hours today .
__label__0 the feel of the wheel is nice and i like the side scrolling feature .
__label__0 a definite num_extend for how they handled this .
__label__0 am very disappointed that i still can t wear my shoes ! .
__label__0 it didn t fit in my bathtub , which is a standard size .
__label__0 we plugged in an extra headset laying around the house .
__label__0 this case looks nice but that s about it .
__label__0 it takes several passes through some types of hair to cut it .
__label__0 i contacted q cell and they replaced the back cover .
__label__0 i hope it will be a better choice .
__label__0 i love that it uses natural ingredients but it was ineffective on my skin .
__label__0 after a num_extend try i received the same product .
__label__0 most products are for dandruff caused by dry scalp .
__label__0 over and over and over and over again .
__label__0 this product was not in functioning condition when delivered .
__label__0 this is a worthless item that makes no sense at all .
__label__0 worked best on older new england house with narrow staircase .
__label__0 might work for others , didn t work for me .
__label__0 not to mention it did not fit my screen completely .
__label__0 i thought that all of the possibilities would be awesome .
__label__0 it was all potatoes and had very little clam flavor .
__label__0 taking it out of the box i found the design to be awkward .
__label__0 i purchased this jawbone hd as a replacement for an older jawbone thinker .
__label__0 i reported it havent heard a word about it .
__label__0 i was hoping for a bit better than this from amazon .
__label__0 this case is cute however the is the only good thing about it .
__label__0 i ve come to the conclusion that i ve wasted my money .
__label__0 i would not recomend this for a tmobile , mytouch phone to anyone .
__label__0 the good pieces that i manages to salvage the birds refuse to touch .
__label__0 he enjoys this toy , but can get the treats out fairly quickly .
__label__0 like how many times you face the <UNK> and how easily they are beaten .
__label__0 i ordered num_num and find this to be a <UNK> mistake .
__label__0 if you are grinding dry items , it should be ok .
__label__0 the entire thing fits in the palm of my child s hand .
__label__0 i ordered these from amazon since i could find them nowhere in my area .
__label__0 so what it comes down to is that u get what u paid for .
__label__0 the balm is crap more like a vaseline stick .
__label__0 i guess it fails in the truth department on its advertising .
__label__0 in this case , it s a big disappointment for num_extend
__label__0 i bought this product for feeding my num_num persian cats while on vacation .
__label__0 it is a poor performer when it comes to odor retention and clumping .
__label__0 do not buy this product ! the photos are horribly , horribly misleading .
__label__0 it adds size o an already pretty big system .
__label__0 armada lacks the epic scope of similar games like homeworld or even starcraft .
__label__0 they were huge , yet the same size in the leather is tight .
__label__0 they also make noise if you happen to touch one against the other .
__label__0 it worked great for the first couple of weeks then it just stopped completely .
__label__0 spend the extra bucks and get the <UNK> knee bands .
__label__0 unfortunately , not my blackberry nor my cell phone .
__label__0 i contacted the seller and was given a refund .
__label__0 the graphics are most definitely improved over the previous version .
__label__0 it was almost like pokemon yellow in the fighting system .
__label__0 it does this to a very significant degree and is extremely uncomfortable to wear .
__label__0 there must be an engineering issue with the motor of the toy .
__label__0 the quality is declined quickly by heat exposure .
__label__0 the main flavor to come through is cinnamon and the slight sweetness of stevia .
__label__0 i was also very disappointed at how quickly it drains the batteries .
__label__0 i can not send it back due to shipping requirements .
__label__0 as the clock clicked by num_extend i still felt sluggish .
__label__0 <UNK> , the coffee always stays in that bottom wedge section .
__label__0 i can t send it back again because i don t have it .
