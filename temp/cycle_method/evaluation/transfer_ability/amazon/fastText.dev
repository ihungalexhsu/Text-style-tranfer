__label__1 this is a very nice case , it fits just right and it closes and opens nicely .
__label__1 unlocked phones carrier unlocked do not require activation and will take any gsm sim standard size .
__label__1 the best thing about this is that food doesn t stain the inside .
__label__1 for the average kitchen i suspect this would last a lifetime .
__label__1 this was a great replacement for our bodum french press .
__label__1 my old charger s cable was flimsy and it stopped working right when bent in a certain position .
__label__1 saves your hands from getting cut and lids dropping in your food .
__label__1 i can put salad veggies in here together and they all come out uniformly .
__label__1 anyway , if you need the right angle , then it will be a num_num star review for you .
__label__1 this extended battery was excellent , price and product . . . can t be beat .
__label__1 so in the future we will share one .
__label__1 they make the water taste much better and help rid the water of nasty things .
__label__1 what were they thinking ? so glad i could still find the digital display foreman .
__label__1 it is sleek looking and it cleans up very well .
__label__1 using it to charge my galaxy num_extend right now .
__label__1 i was using a griffin unit that has buttons instead of motion sensing to control the iphone .
__label__1 having had cheaper large pots , i <UNK> away from buying this expensive pot .
__label__1 it fell and scooped right underneath the egg .
__label__1 were it not for my glasses , it would be perfect .
__label__1 i purchased these form amazon in num_num and we are still using them on a daily basis .
__label__1 only thing when it gets dropped it gets a bit scratched up on the corners .
__label__1 one gratin recipe called for num_num grated potatoes .
__label__1 little by little , i am learning to make our food from scratch .
__label__1 these are hard to find in local stores .
__label__1 i must say that i love every one of them .
__label__1 i can t say enough good things about this great lid .
__label__1 this reduces the suction which is critical in removing as much water from the carpet as possible .
__label__1 as a household with just two people , i find that the medium sized loaf is perfect for us .
__label__1 i wish it would just beep until i shut it off .
__label__1 they also appear to be better made and more durable .
__label__1 i absolutely love this thing ! ! ! ! ! ! i used to have the mr .
__label__1 all the rest is good . the phone is terrific as a phone .
__label__1 my very first cup was heaven , i ve never experienced such a robust , wonderful coffee .
__label__1 but once in a while , a large skillet is called for , and this one is perfect .
__label__1 it does have the cool v handle and i look forward to many years of use .
__label__1 so i don t worry about warping or discoloration of the handle .
__label__1 if you prefer <UNK> , cut them in half or even quarters .
__label__1 i made my favorite apricot brandy pound cake in it and it has never looked or tasted so good .
__label__1 found a good price on amazon and it included free shipping , couldn t go wrong .
__label__1 we use this every morning making our espresso .
__label__1 is it the closest i found for fit , volume , clarity out and in etc ? absolutely .
__label__1 you can use it to rest , <UNK> on it , too .
__label__1 this charger works well considering it is not an actually apple product .
__label__1 the color is more vibrant that the picture and makes it easy to find in my purse .
__label__1 the screen protector is a nice feature as well . no complaints ! .
__label__1 keeps food warm and i am using it regularly .
__label__1 all of my other tongs don t hold the food as well .
__label__1 does exactly what you would expect it to do .
__label__1 i gave it num_num stars because i had to return the first on .
__label__1 i m very excited about using this attachment with my old kitchenaid mixer that i bought back in num_extend
__label__1 lids fit perfect after several washings in the dishwasher top shelf .
__label__1 i took a key to it and it still looks great .
__label__1 music and speech are rendered really , really well .
__label__1 you will ask yourself how did i ever live without this great mixer .
__label__1 i ve has the num_extend model for num_num months and it is great .
__label__1 unlike some people who use this water for only cooking purposes , i drink this water and love it .
__label__1 the surface is rubberized so it won t slip in your hands .
__label__1 easy <UNK> , just slip your finger in and it slices through the peel .
__label__1 however , if you re in the middle of cooking something , this can be a <UNK> .
__label__1 for him , he gets a dessert , a veg , a salad and a main .
__label__1 riedel is one of the tests that is easy for even beginning drinkers to see the difference in .
__label__1 keeps our counters looking more neat and organized .
__label__1 hard to tell , however , when measuring water or other clear liquids .
__label__1 i use it everyday and its been great .
__label__1 this headset is exactly as described by the manufacturer .
__label__1 my husband has num_num cup of french press in the mornings .
__label__1 the juice tastes delicious and the consistency is smooth with a perfect amount of juicy foam at the top .
__label__1 great for slicing where surface tension is high and inner stability threatened .
__label__1 as far as the filters on all the brands , they are basically charcoal based .
__label__1 having the right tools makes any task easier .
__label__1 we ve had it almost num_num months and it still works like the day we got it .
__label__1 perfect , well build and also perfectly fit all kinds of <UNK> .
__label__1 this juicer does a good job making this drink which i really can t make in the vitamix .
__label__1 i <UNK> replacing it with the bosch universal plus but instead went with this kitchenaid pro num_extend
__label__1 great cookware . you can keep a pot of chili or pasta sauce simmering without scorching for hours .
__label__1 ok , i m with everybody when it comes to this tray .
__label__1 it heats fast and is very efficient in heating .
__label__1 they work great and especially for frying chicken to searing steaks .
__label__1 thank goodness for amazon ! i found the exact match .
__label__1 we got this after our old beater began to flake off .
__label__1 the stones were easy to heat in the microwave , and they held heat through dinner .
__label__1 besides that it has been a great case .
__label__1 a finer grind coffee will give you major flavor without having to use so much i found .
__label__1 considering the above , it s well worth this price .
__label__1 she loves the shade of yellow and says it is a perfect addition to her other fiesta sets .
__label__1 bought these because of plans to take cakes to fund <UNK> .
__label__1 this cover fits it nicely and together they do make a statement of color .
__label__1 all you have to do is pulse the food chopper until the desired size is attained .
__label__1 not too big or too small but just right .
__label__1 normally i m partial to the oxo stuff , but this juice press is miles better .
__label__1 it s cleared up a lot of space in my pantry and made getting to my spices much handier .
__label__1 only issue is when you first put them on you have to have patience and a steady hand .
__label__1 every thing comes with it that is needed to hang it on the wall .
__label__1 i think they ll last as long as i want them around .
__label__1 and the retractable cord is also a very nice feature .
__label__1 never have found anything as good at this as these bamboo brushes . . . ! .
__label__1 the unit size is nice and there is room to fry a lot of potatoes .
__label__1 we are back to buy another cordless vacuum .
__label__1 but you can use paper filters in this machine if you want to .
__label__1 it looks as good as it did when i first got it .
__label__1 great for slow cooking baby food and for dips at a great price .
__label__1 love this knife , a definite go to staple piece in my kitchen .
__label__1 the handle feels a little plasticky , and less grippy or weighted than expected .
__label__1 i wish i would have had this when i was single .
__label__1 they seem to be pretty accurate and durable as well .
__label__1 i cant believe how much hair and dust it picked up .
__label__1 bought this for my mother when her old bunn coffee maker wouldn t quit leaking .
__label__1 but i can t say that i really like popcorn without that butter .
__label__1 air vents like the ones in some of the other review pics are the ones it works with .
__label__1 it s great because of it s heavy duty material .
__label__1 it looks good doing it too , though that s frankly not a consideration .
__label__1 everyone heard me clearly and i heard them clearly .
__label__1 the batter was so thick i had to spoon it under the support bars .
__label__1 the cradle is snapped onto the mount and is ready for use .
__label__1 work well as a serving bowl or as a soup bowl .
__label__1 i did not bother reading the directions , and was able to set it up easily .
__label__1 however , it over heats if i use it to long without a break .
__label__1 the padding is a nice touch and there is no sag in it when its hanging from the vent .
__label__1 this is a terrific item if your washer is not right near your dryer .
__label__1 the parts were perfect and fit together easily .
__label__1 i just received the num_extend screen protector and i would definitely say that it is made of good quality .
__label__1 they clean easy , lightweight and take no space to store upright .
__label__1 i used num_num grams of flour to num_num eggs for my pasta dough .
__label__1 but i wasn t that impressed with it after my first use .
__label__0 if you drop it for any reason , its likely broken .
__label__0 but its probably more to do with the storage than removing the adults ! .
__label__0 after seeing similar hoses on tv , i was excited to try this out .
__label__0 these did nothing special for my cats that an ordinary bed or blanket couldn t provide .
__label__0 swimming is no better because enemies can always see you and you can only hide underwater while being still .
__label__0 this must be done carefully or else you will dislodge the charms .
__label__0 i will never buy anything from this brand again .
__label__0 at least you can take a shower afterwards .
__label__0 and there was a huge gap that would never close and exposed a part of the phone .
__label__0 she can t walk with it becuase it either falls apart or it trips her .
__label__0 the scent is still kind of strange , and on your face scent definitely matters .
__label__0 indicating that a good portion of the <UNK> has been cut in favor of the flour .
__label__0 normally i love love love this product but it tasted odd and i ended up throwing it all away .
__label__0 i d send it back if i could do so without paying postage .
__label__0 it is all in the marketing , do not fall for the hype .
__label__0 it s just burn and <UNK> your skin , nothing else .
__label__0 if you want to use the shuffle or program features you have to use the menu on you tv .
__label__0 the smallest is an aggressive chewer , and i thought that this would be a great toy for him .
__label__0 i have to say that i am not a fan of this item .
__label__0 <UNK> grips move your weight to the base of your hand .
__label__0 i installed this on a mossberg num_num and stripped the threads .
__label__0 i wanted them for playing tennis but did not even get that far .
__label__0 mind you , i received excellent customer service from the seller , but the product just didn t work .
__label__0 i cannot express how embarrassing such a situation is .
__label__0 they are people who just bought the product and haven t had much experience with it .
__label__0 it also has an optical out , which it should .
__label__0 you mix it with num_num ounces of water and you get this bland medicine like drink out of it .
__label__0 anyways i ve been using <UNK> for the past two years and regret trying to go back to on .
__label__0 then it dies and you gain about num_extend xp points .
__label__0 i tried dying both my lashes and brows , and both were a disaster .
__label__0 i found it to time consuming to try it very often and bought the real sausage making equipment .
__label__0 it is the deep purple color of a dark purple eggplant .
__label__0 they are very thin leather with a cheap sole and probably cost about ten dollars maximum to produce .
__label__0 i knew coming in that this game wasn t going to be the madden of old .
__label__0 it can take under four hours to beat it .
__label__0 i have always dreamed of a solid bluetooth headset for my phone .
__label__0 it also uses extra num_extend from the gun to move num_num <UNK> around and down to the barrel .
__label__0 then i was trying to <UNK> the top holder .
__label__0 not sure if this was from the acid in it or something else , maybe the cinnamon .
__label__0 the most recently bag contained mostly smaller bully sticks that reeked terribly .
__label__0 i also thought the lace trim was itchy .
__label__0 this kettle looks pretty but doesn t turn off once it boils .
__label__0 i got ripped off and it s not worth the money or effort .
__label__0 i bought another lot thinking it was a lot problem but it was the same .
__label__0 then it finishes with a stevia after taste ! yuck .
__label__0 i personally think its because these are <UNK> , and seem to overheat very quickly .
__label__0 i bought this because of the high reviews .
__label__0 it leaks when it s level , and faster when it s tipped <UNK> in the wind .
__label__0 : update : i did find the directions for installation in the envelope .
__label__0 i cooked chicken and steak on it the first night and it worked okay .
__label__0 i received this product a couple days ago .
__label__0 i far exceed the suggested system , yet my game stuttered in the strangest , seemingly least demanding places .
__label__0 unhappy with it , actually i already replaced them .
__label__0 don t try this in a top loader , it will probably destroy the mat .
__label__0 it was claimed that this was compatible with my panasonic cordless landline system .
__label__0 maybe you need some <UNK> in your hair sometimes just to be able to get a brush through it .
__label__0 it has wheat derived ingredients , which causes skin irritation for a lot of people .
__label__0 if the toy actually worked consistently , it would be great .
__label__0 i took this and could tell no difference , except it turns your poo the color of the box .
__label__0 i stretched the rubber band and it worked ! for num_num minutes .
__label__0 it was very difficult to get started and keep going .
__label__0 i am a true size num_num and that s what i bought .
__label__0 i have one or two other one star items but many four and five star items .
__label__0 i really wanted to give this system a fair shot .
__label__0 their dmso is produced through a chemical reaction .
__label__0 however , it is asking to much to have only num_num installs .
__label__0 my coworker described it <UNK> autumn leaf red whatever that means , ha .
__label__0 if you screw up you can t restart the race ! which leads me to my next num_extend backtracking .
__label__0 i have brows that are fairly thin but mostly they stop short of the average length brow .
__label__0 i ve had this unit for a few years .
__label__0 this crap is for the masses that don t know any better .
__label__0 with that said , the flow on this hose isn t that great and the connectors suck .
__label__0 there is also a high <UNK> that mold could form there during storage .
__label__0 <UNK> describes in his excellent review of this product .
__label__0 i found that one must go painfully slow to try and prevent that from happening .
__label__0 you d actually have to start a brand new game to do so .
__label__0 it started to have clicking sounds and searches would take num_num minutes; this was after num_num months of use .
__label__0 it is a novel jewelry box or <UNK> holder .
__label__0 i swear the triggers are sensitive to gravity .
__label__0 when you mix with your conditioner , you have to pour it .
__label__0 i am not computer <UNK> , but you have to have a systems degree to install this unit .
__label__0 if you want spicy just go for chai .
__label__0 i think this will be really cool when some of the bugs are worked out .
__label__0 so my question is what do you want to do with it and why .
__label__0 no instructions are included , although it s possible to google some good sites .
__label__0 they are only num_num calories because they are unbelievably small not because they are nutritional .
__label__0 well i will blame it on this thing , the screws striped my rifle .
__label__0 i also tightened the tension on the perch in case birds found the <UNK> disconcerting .
__label__0 another parent stated that the toy is small .
__label__0 i bought the charger in june and it was broken by august .
__label__0 not my cup of tea ! but if you like spicy teas then this is for you .
__label__0 the rose flavor is the one highlight but there was not much of that in the package .
__label__0 now whenever i leave the house , my dogs have to be locked up .
__label__0 despite the description and the packaging , these gloves are not cotton flock lined .
__label__0 there is nothing special that <UNK> that this is worth num_num dollars .
__label__0 i wish i had paid better attention before purchasing .
__label__0 so no stars deducted for that . however , i like a body wash that lathers up well .
__label__0 to add insult to injury , the interface is pretty awful , too .
__label__0 after many hours , i just put the battery into the phone and it was fully charged .
__label__0 i had this on subscribe and save for a while .
__label__0 i have heard this was a good brand , and the video looked great .
__label__0 most aren t related to how the top is screwed on or the filter basket is latched .
__label__0 one of the internal ports is bent so i cannot plug a usb into it .
__label__0 i was disappointed since i normally like the little people toys .
__label__0 barely past the knees , it was extremely tight .
__label__0 i don t know why they ship the returned product as new one .
__label__0 i gave them each the recommended amount , waited , and nothing .
__label__0 we ordered several different colors and patterns , all by rothco .
__label__0 i am disappointed i bought the game without <UNK> it first .
__label__0 when i first got this item , it was great and had alot of fun with it .
__label__0 they do work , and my cats learned to stay away from the cans very quickly .
__label__0 i m sure there a method to this <UNK> , but it s on , y me that cares .
__label__0 i tried it for a week , and now know for sure .
__label__0 the final death blow to the sound quality comes from the voice acting .
__label__0 i made two identical <UNK> at the same time .
__label__0 you d be better off with the older style that doesn t use batteries .
__label__0 people complain that the xbox version could ve been more realistic .
__label__0 i saw these recommended and hoped they d improve my digestion .
__label__0 the product was a waste of my money .
__label__0 you see , there are many filters in this machine .
__label__0 it was only supporting num_extend but otherwise setup was so easy .
__label__0 i realized that it s just like the original , just bigger .
__label__0 do this for num_num minutes and it can lower your blood pressure maybe num_num points on top .
__label__0 just like all the other <UNK> brushes , the back of the brushes slide out .
__label__0 first , there are similar games with better <UNK> , like myst .
__label__0 cheap , just <UNK> covered the phone and it is hard to get <UNK> off .
__label__0 if you put much pressure on your head while using it , it hurts .
__label__0 i think the little bit of pressure on the button is what caused my phone to act up .
__label__0 i m dead serious , the only way to attack is with missle launches .
__label__0 the ac adapter is num_extend at num_extend amps which seems to provide more than enough voltage .
__label__0 i did not notice any effect from this supplement .
__label__0 the textured nubs on the back of the watch are awful .
__label__0 i have acne prone skin and i was hoping that it would help clear up breakouts .
__label__0 i love adventure games and own all the originals from sierra and lucasarts .
__label__0 i didn t have a good experience with this product .
__label__0 the tines are flimsy and there are not have enough tines to be effective .
__label__0 the focus button is the only cool part of the game .
__label__0 they have the lowest price anywhere for this game .
__label__0 on one of my previous cars , i tried valeo num_num ultimate blades similar to anco contour .
__label__0 a box of num_num is like a one year supply for me .
__label__0 i use it all the time in my recliner .
__label__0 water tastes great through a brita filter , but this pitcher is poorly designed .
__label__0 only to discover to my horror that the cheap p . o . s .
__label__0 i bought this product to help even out some redness and solve mild acne .
__label__0 get the ground hogs , you ll get what you pay for : msr ground hog stake kit .
__label__0 you need a flat area about two inches square , where you want to mount it .
__label__0 people say later you download more , but thats just a rumor .
__label__0 it s quick and fun and doesn t require too much thought .
__label__0 yet , weirdly , the spandex around my ankles is way too tight .
__label__0 she stated that i most likely had a refurbished unit , which immediately made sense .
__label__0 the main issue is that the pad is located in the wrong place .
__label__0 this thing made notice the past tense great popcorn .
__label__0 the set is missing a firm , flat brush for packing shadow onto the lid .
__label__0 it looks great , but don t try to move it .
__label__0 you have to build your town , make soldiers , etc .
__label__0 on my scale , it weighs over num_num ounces with batteries .
__label__0 this is so convenient when you want charge your extra battery .
__label__0 she played with it for about num_num hours total the first few days she received it .
__label__0 she spoke pretty good english but she was on drugs or something .
__label__0 they re packed in there so well you need to scrape them num_extend
__label__0 but this spanx camisole was definitely not for me .
__label__0 but first and foremost , a gadget must work .
__label__0 i m pretty sensitive to heavily scented things and it just made my stomach turn while trying to sleep .
__label__0 i also don t care for the brown color .
__label__0 i don t want my children thinking an f is a g and q is an e .
__label__0 salicylic acid seems to be better for me for now .
__label__0 we took it apart and substituted <UNK> which work very well and won t break .
__label__0 after only a few months of use it is leaking from the <UNK> .
__label__0 i had to throw out the remaining packets after trying several .
__label__0 thank god for ritz crackers as i was then able to consume .
__label__0 the quality of desktop speakers has risen to a very high level in the last couple of years .
__label__0 we received this knife for our wedding august num_extend
__label__0 i am ok with gun recoil , and moving slow when wearing a bunch of armor .
__label__0 is indoors , so weather conditions do not num_extend
__label__0 i threw away the lilac <UNK> the next day .
__label__0 after giving it a week , i am tossing it out .
__label__0 i didn t see anything special about this one that deserves a higher price .
__label__0 i now have about num_num red bumps on my forehead that i cant get rid of .
__label__0 i have bought a lot of mascara in my day , and this is just like any other .
__label__0 thankfully it s under num_num days so i m returning it .
__label__0 this didn t stay in place at all for me no matter what shoes i had on .
__label__0 i also found the hover bikes to be nearly impossible to control .
__label__0 i got it set up , and then tried to dry some dishes in it .
__label__0 as soon as i stopped using it , my face stopped breaking out .
__label__0 my old compact dryer blows more air and as a result , is easier to use and style with .
__label__0 i ve been buying bali products for num_num years and this is my first complaint .
__label__0 i have a strict skincare regimen and when i heard all of the reviews and how its so great .
__label__0 apple needs to understand that their ipods designs are flawed .
__label__0 units have horrible <UNK> and no sort of structure .
__label__0 so basically your buying a cheap coffee maker with a good carafe .
__label__0 i was not really impressed with this sprayer .
__label__0 my characters started moving by themselves . . . planes started flying themselves .
__label__0 it turns out this battery only has a capacity of num_extend and i am feeling very ripped off .
__label__0 the taste was bitter and sharp , not smooth and had a yucky fake taste .
__label__0 on the whole the gameplay tries to deliver an adequate amount of mayhem .
__label__0 the side with the coconut oil had better texture , tightening and my skin looked a lot more <UNK> .
__label__0 i wish i had of researched more before my purchase of this .
__label__0 its sensitivity reminds me of <UNK> num_num speed film .
__label__0 saeco was very responsive back then and picked up the machine and repaired it promptly .
__label__0 it s bulky and heavy to move , yet made out of flimsy plastic .
__label__0 so i know his size these were either missed marked or num_extend or something .
__label__0 maybe designed to fit num_extend not num_extend do not line up either .
__label__0 but that s a bit expensive , so just look around .
__label__0 it s so small i didn t even see it for what it was .
__label__0 we rated this lower because of what we like in a game .
__label__0 she rarely played with it after the novelty wore off .
__label__0 in my trip , my daughter and i eventually took turns to carry the bag .
__label__0 i returned these cause the fit and the look of them didn t suit me .
__label__0 description needs to state the size of the adapter .
__label__0 num_num day things were good then my peas disappeared .
__label__0 these are cheap head phones and the style isn t too bad since they are flat to the ears .
__label__0 i bought these on impulse as they were on sale .
__label__0 do not get magnetic ones you ll just wasted your money .
__label__0 your objective now is to find a way back home how creative .
__label__0 my old ms optical mouse never had any problems .
__label__0 i purchased thinking this would be a fun indoor activity .
__label__0 comparing the two they don t look the same as the one listed in the picture either .
__label__0 bought this for my daughter and i have seen balloons bigger than this thing .
__label__0 this stuff is not cheap and this brand doesn t work as a sweetener , in my opinion .
__label__0 i don t know how that slot will affect the temperature holding ability of the thermal pot .
__label__0 she will get frustrated with the hair and give up .
__label__0 they are not the tasty treat of the past and these were made in different country .
__label__0 as an alternative , i recommend taking a multivitamin with a glass of water .
__label__0 this clear one had the power button break within days .
__label__0 and even then , i would replay the former titles again before sending buying this one .
__label__0 must be something cheap from china , so i tossed it .
__label__0 yes they are attractive , i love the simple lines and the curve at the bottom .
__label__0 i followed the instructions and hung it in an area well populated with yellow jackets .
__label__0 i had a frame fit <UNK> as well as a <UNK> in the past .
__label__0 out of all of the stray hairs on my brows , only three were removed with these strips .
__label__0 the programmers make sure that you have hardly any life before you reach the end .
__label__0 the product has nothing on the label to help you know what is in it .
__label__0 hey it s been a while since i used this .
__label__0 you better point the device right at the ir port on your camera .
__label__0 after one day the adjustment dial began to come away from wristband .
__label__0 nowhere on the page did i see that this is a vegetarian product .
__label__0 this is especially evident during cutscenes when you are required to operate the controls .
__label__0 if it were good , my kids would probably drink num_num at a sitting .
__label__0 it is a very nice and cute pan but i will not start out with damaged goods .
__label__0 i just purchased this one , and after num_extend use , cut my finger .
__label__0 these are made in china and you can draw your own conclusions .
__label__0 mounted on my benjamin <UNK> , would not hold position .
__label__0 i opened the box , set up the pool very easy and began filling .
__label__0 it s fast , convenient , and a healthy start to the day .
__label__0 my wife was unable to operate it . we cleaned it up and she returned it today .
__label__0 the kids are not basically making up what they do as they go along .
__label__0 she does seem to like the merrick bg dry food .
__label__0 we got it out of the box and it looked fine .
__label__0 that s what makes this game so damn frustrating and boring .
__label__0 i ve tried adjusting the volume to see if that would help , no such luck .
__label__0 great cleaner , but num_num stars for the bottle design .
__label__0 stick to <UNK> <UNK> if you want a good source of creatine .
__label__0 do not buy ! do not use ! unnatural color .
__label__0 this is a genuinely useless product , at least as far as squirrels are concerned .
__label__0 i thought it was me , and i didnt remember what it was supposed to be like .
__label__0 at it best it puffs and goes out like the candle on a birthday cake .
__label__0 please ignore those reviewers who played a game or two and said this game was great .
__label__0 i really never understood the craze of this game .
__label__0 i recently bought this card to add on to my hp desktop computer .
__label__0 my computer crashed recently and took the hard drive with it .
__label__0 fortunately , i opened the bag and poured it out in a bowl before eating any .
__label__0 clean design with an easy to read dial .
__label__0 i wish they carried reliable products , but they , like i thought it was a superior brand .
__label__0 i finished the num_num oz glass , but soon after began to feel nauseous .
__label__0 i bought this based on all the reviews i read here .
__label__0 incredibly worthless and complex drm that ruins <UNK> of owning the num_extend
__label__0 the adhesive doesn t work at all , and so you ll need to glue them on .
__label__0 has better heat transference , cheaper , and looks and feels more durable .
__label__0 did not stay together well and was advertised that it folds and did not fold , sent back .

__label__0 my friend swears by this nail polish and says it makes her nails hard and therefore able to grow .
__label__0 i think i could have gotten the same results with aluminum foil .
__label__0 i thought this looked really cool in pictures .

__label__0 but i seem to be a little bit sensitive to num_extend and apparently i m not the only one .
__label__0 you have to cut the cord in half .
__label__0 these are bright bags with wacky prints on them .
__label__0 all i remember is that it was thick and highly <UNK> .
__label__0 they re also made in china now , which i don t like .
__label__0 i got a large eye screw , installed it in wall opposite toilet with large sail boat rope .
__label__0 becareful , it seemed to calm me down just a tiny bit .
__label__0 the aftertaste is just way too herbal , grassy tasting for me .
__label__0 so most of the calories is coming from sugar and fat .
__label__0 they are using limited activations to prevent second hand sales and to limit the lifetime of the game .
__label__0 but the illumination does not turn on at the desired time .
__label__0 only after i downloaded the detailed instructions from their website was i able to get it to work properly .
__label__0 cat is not a huge fan and i really got sick of stepping on them because it hurt .

__label__0 i thought at first it was reading celcius but that didn t work either .
__label__0 i had fun with it , although it does not merit it s price tag as is .
__label__0 legitimate game companies don t need to resort to cheap tricks like that .
__label__0 this compression support elastic knee does not provide any knee support .
__label__0 if you get this keep it away from the hot pan if you are not currently flipping a pancake .

__label__0 i ve used marble runs from other manufacturers and have not experienced this level of poor design .
__label__0 this put a pretty good blade on my kitchen knife set calphalon the first few times i used it .
__label__0 i returned this ! i could not adjust it all .
__label__0 it s all peach , i don t taste any tea .
__label__0 the cost to make one is probably num_num cents .
__label__0 yet my hand seems too small to fit over the ball and push the buttons .
__label__0 they never really liked this thing even though it gives my two big fat rats more room .

__label__0 i did not get that , but the sticker on the tine says it was with handle .
__label__0 i found the camera to be quite good , though i never used any video features .

__label__0 this unit worked great for about a week .
__label__0 no power at all no matter what angle .
__label__0 the flour being enriched would not provide the nutritional value of whole wheat .
__label__0 this foundation did not even out my skin tone whatsoever .
__label__0 if you want to get rid of hair , try waxing .
__label__0 it happened so many times that accidental pressing of multifunction button <UNK> last number .
__label__0 it is probably a perfect item for someone who likes quick , weak coffee one cup at a time .
__label__0 bought this to replaced a scoop made in num_extend
__label__0 but the pain relief , for me at least , has been minimal .
__label__0 if you use enough to get your solution to jell , the texture is poor and rubbery .
__label__0 i would get the bigger version of this product and not waste your time on these little darts .
__label__0 after a week , i called for a status .

__label__0 the case is big and has lots of <UNK> everything else is bad news .
__label__0 this means that when cooking steam will condense there and oils from food will also collect there .
__label__0 the changing lights are definitely adding to the novelty .
__label__0 i liked it at first , but the bearings failed after one year of light use .
__label__0 it has a nice wood smell , is super absorbent , and is easy to clean up .
__label__0 this game is stupid ! don t <UNK> think about buying this item ! .
__label__0 so thats my only complaint for a $ case .
__label__0 i bought this pan because it was rated pretty good , but trust me this pan is garbage .
__label__0 customer service from this company is also very poor .
__label__0 had to continuously reboot router due to lost <UNK> customer support useless .
__label__0 it is cheaper to buy another cable than it would be to ship the defective one back .
__label__0 this is a great skillet , especially for the price .
__label__0 i used it for a while although it unfortunately <UNK> removing my num_extend from its speck case .
__label__0 finer tastes however will reject this stuff , i think because it has little cheese .
__label__0 and it was very unlikely to shatter if dropped .
__label__0 way to much ! the hearts are ugly and i was just unhappy .
__label__0 they went on fine , but i wouldn t buy them again .
__label__0 this thing must be on the slow boat from china .
__label__0 not happy and therefore i cannot recommend this bra .
__label__0 there s a lot of work to be done .
__label__0 i have a very hard time understanding where the ball is supposed to go .

__label__0 the pills just make it a little easier to stick to the diet ! .
__label__0 i called kodak and was advised to download their new software .
__label__0 was taking product and i had to stop , as my stomach was very upset after using it .
__label__0 this product is made of very stiff material and has a very small opening to fill and empty it .
__label__0 i cleaned it as directed , waited for the green light and poured in the batter .
__label__0 since moving to the country , we ve had a problem with clothes moths .
__label__0 even when i push the ball , can t get much speed .
__label__0 this is one of marvel s more pathetic attempts at a video game .
__label__0 i would not recommend these for who would find those issues to be deal breakers .
__label__0 i may have to cut them off my rims .
__label__0 i pushed the pin back in and the clip is working .
__label__0 although they liked it , it did not <UNK> standards or liking .
__label__0 i know many people swear by this product , but i think it is a crappy product .
__label__0 this tire has kevlar in it ? yeah , right .
__label__0 i m not even remotely impressed with the chatter phone .
__label__0 the sound quality is pretty good , but these headphones are not loud .

__label__0 and maybe they ll get there if they haven t already .
__label__0 buyer needs to beware of the expiration date on the product .
__label__0 i normally purchase the smaller can of evo , but the % my cats would not touch .
__label__0 save your time and money , order them from somebody else .
__label__0 uses the remote , and shuts off you ll probably never have a problem .
__label__0 that s very accurate and i wish i d paid more attention to that feedback .
__label__0 even adjusted to the smallest configuration , they are still too big for me .
__label__0 the clips on the edges do not fit , do not clip , it falls apart .
__label__0 this did not work well for us at all .
__label__0 i should have followed suit but this was a little cheaper .
__label__0 the fact that this had baking soda in it really means nothing .
__label__0 <UNK> are not strong so if looking for strong <UNK> that is not your cup of tea .
__label__0 i am thinking maybe keep it in the fridge would be better .
__label__0 the sound actually almost sounds as if it came from the console versions .
__label__0 unfortunatley my cat does not seem to mind .
__label__0 it s not hurting my face , but it s not making it better either .
__label__0 you drive around to the bad guy and <UNK> him or kill him .
__label__0 maybe i got a defective one , but the bag i received was not num_num degrees .
__label__0 i bought these mitts for the high reviews but i was insanely disappointed .

__label__0 the second was the same and just quit working after a few weeks .
__label__0 i have in and went to the the <UNK> store and bought one that actually works .
__label__0 they leak ground spices out of every pore so if possible stick to using them for larger leafy spices .
__label__0 i heard they were made in spain , however i received a unit which was made in china .
__label__0 the second time there was a mess and the clock would not work when i replaced the batteries .
__label__0 i have an old watch which sits on the table about num_num feet from me .
__label__0 if you want this to just protect your lighter , then its perfect .
__label__0 the handle doesn t stay upright , so the child has to be a good walker to use it .
__label__0 i would still only give it about num_num stars though .
__label__0 the num_extend i bought doesn t work properly with my <UNK> num_extend
__label__0 the cables in almost all of these have cracked .
__label__0 i thought i would get this and carry her in it when she became fatigued .

__label__0 the shoulders stick out several inches past the hole where the arm sticks out .
__label__0 i had ordered this face cream along with the hand cream and the smell made me sick .
__label__0 this brush was defective out of the box .
__label__0 there must be a better clipper out there and i ll keep looking .
__label__0 you can barely tell what element something is or anything else .
__label__0 i was doing all these things while waiting on hold .
__label__0 i connected it to three devices and it did not work .
__label__0 within a couple of days all it did was click .
__label__0 it also stretches , which makes it hard to wear in tighter shoes .
__label__0 it would do this with all the coins .
__label__0 the num_num degree turn will works better as the waste water does not rush directly to the hose seal .
__label__0 i finished the entire bottle anyway but the symptoms did not improve .
__label__0 you have to fly for minutes to find a enemy , and then you have to find nine more .
__label__0 this is one of the most overrated games of the mario series .
__label__0 this compared to the old pointy apple corer . forget this one .
__label__0 i disagree with the other haribo fans on this product page .
__label__0 in my mind , i m owed this as i ve paid for it .
__label__0 i have to wonder about safety as some do , with all the other deception attached to these things .
__label__0 the person that i was speaking with complained about the clarity of my voice .
__label__0 graphic is good but not spectacular considering the game being a resource hog .
__label__0 well the taste is very salty and extremely bitter .
__label__0 again , xbox owners get leftovers from a num_extend ported num_extend
__label__0 because this doesn t even seem like crayola quality .
__label__0 i feel sorry that i purchased this case it s cheap , and you have to build it yourself .
__label__0 must be <UNK> small feet . this is a very frustrating device .
__label__0 all i can sa at this point , try at you own risk .

__label__0 i prefer a stylus that feels more like a pen in my hand .
__label__0 this review is for the net wash plus , not the actual neti pot .
__label__0 the snap closure on this collar is a little too easy to open .
__label__0 i ve owned almost every system that has come out , and been happy with most of them .
__label__0 case did not align up with my samsung num_extend very flexible and cheap .
__label__0 there are much sturdier walkers out there and also equipped with better activities than this one ! .
__label__0 figured i would then put the rest in my wife s accord .
__label__0 i received them all scratched up and they didn t last long before cracking .
__label__0 when i turned on the computer it went crazy and burned out the motherboard .
__label__0 these are much smaller hence do not fully <UNK> your ears .
__label__0 you shoot and miss , and shoot and miss and so on .
__label__0 perhaps this is an acquired skill , but i can t get the planes to do anything for me .
__label__0 thanks amazon readers for posting your helpful information .
__label__0 it was rather cheap , i ended up giving it away because it was cheaply made ! .
__label__0 this product flaked off of my nails within hours of application .
__label__0 the first two that came were absolutely filthy , having grease marks all over the edges .

__label__0 more like watch some stuff , play a little , watch more , play a little .
__label__0 these are the worst thing i have ever gotten from amazon .
__label__0 if you are a novice gamer , you will get bored with this game .
__label__0 now they wanted almost $ to fix it .
__label__0 i bought it a sephora so i paid $ instead of the better price here .
__label__0 unfortunately , this title has that rushed to deadline feel to it and it shows .
__label__0 i bought two because i have two cats .
__label__0 now it s broken for the third time after having just been repaired num_num months ago .
__label__0 the qb , when he steps back and throws the ball to the right , his arm slings left .

__label__0 then adding the black pepper makes it even worse .
__label__0 i love green tea , i love pomegranate , and i love flavored teas .
__label__0 but even at this low price , a cable should last more than num_num months .
__label__0 too bad , it fits my phone nicely and is great protection .
__label__0 <UNK> not sure if i keep it , i didn`t want a regular golden color .
__label__0 you can go to <UNK> <UNK> and num_extend chicago a perfect dark reference ? right next to each other .
__label__0 it relieved the pressure of a <UNK> more than anything , which was helpful .
__label__0 i d opt for a grinder with rave reviews .
__label__0 this case is just too flimsy to case a $ phone .
__label__0 this wax seems to shine my black car quite nicely .
__label__0 they obviously have no experience or business being in the pci card realm .
__label__0 however , he s willing to test the model himself and try to get a solution .
__label__0 the real ones are really bright without having to charge in the sun .
__label__0 i like knorr products and have used them for many years .
__label__0 i travel a lot by motorcycle , camping half the time .
__label__0 i bought this collection for galaga num_extend alone .

__label__0 you are an <UNK> trooper protecting the world from an alien invasion .
__label__0 i was very disappointed with mix num_num in the berry formula .
__label__0 even my last year s camera was much better than this num_extend
__label__0 feels like its going to break any minute .
__label__0 compared to <UNK> , the better stevia packets don t dissolve in cold drinks easily .
__label__0 had to return it because it was impossible to get the time right .
__label__0 i use end frequently and it should not have been moved .
__label__0 i wouldn t say that the controls are that good , though .
__label__0 very thin , thin weave that you can see through if you hold it up to light .
__label__0 they are low in fiber , with a mere num_num gram , and contain num_num grams of carbohydrate .
__label__0 does not make a noticable enough difference in sound quality to justify it s cost .
__label__0 i ve been using this product effectively for about ten years .
__label__0 the shoes do not have enough ventilation for heat . fifth problem .
__label__0 the cables pull the door s up and hold the doors open .

__label__0 so i ve been going tanning for about a month and a half now using this product .
__label__0 i tried this scratcher for my inside only cat and my outside only cat .
__label__0 do some research and you will see that other gamers have the same complaint .
__label__0 but the <UNK> is this company sells old dead batteries , so you probably want to look elsewhere .
__label__0 nintendo next year will release their new gamecube .
__label__0 not everybody is going to dish out thousands of dollars for an <UNK> or some stereo .
__label__0 i usually swear by this stuff so as i said .
__label__0 it may work somewhat , but i can t handle the greasy feeling on my skin .
__label__0 he would pee in the toilet with no problems but this cat takes some pride with his poop .
__label__0 just recently got these and let me tell you .
__label__0 it almost never worked for my dog an australian shepherd .
__label__0 even the box for the gopicnic was bulkier then need be .
__label__0 this is after i already called our isp to reboot the modem .
__label__0 the other pine tar soaps i bought didn t bother me like this one did .
__label__0 this holster is very cheap and the plastic clips that holds the phone in place breaks easily .
__label__0 spreading it on your bacon is the meat lovers equivalent of the popular chocolate donut with chocolate icing .
__label__0 they are not the kind of girls that put there toys on a shelf and leave them there .
__label__0 i returned it for the larger model that i like .
__label__0 within the first week the metal plates had fallen off .
__label__0 loved the colors . then i go check out walmart s mainstay version of this .

__label__0 i bought these googles for my son who swims competitively .
__label__0 i purchased about num_num extra probes for the taylor unit directly from taylor by mail .
__label__0 looks fine in the picture , but in person it just needs more wires i think .
__label__0 avoid this <UNK> research on the internet you find out this is dangerous for for use .
__label__0 i have always a spare because it s not very secure to the camera .
__label__0 my bose bt headset just crapped out and i just bought the num_extend
__label__0 after using it , my hair was still tangled and felt like it had nothing on it .
__label__0 luckily , i have found a cheaper alternative here on amazon that i m not allergic to .
__label__0 also , the spoken dialog is heard about num_num seconds prior to the character s mouths actually moving .
__label__0 most of the plastic continues to break of every time i use it .
__label__0 so glad i didn t go to bed with it on not realizing the issue with this new formula .
__label__0 the <UNK> wheel is crude , and you can actually count the notches as you scroll .
__label__0 it does a superb job of creating a creepy environment for you to play in .
__label__0 boy was i wrong ! it looks like a piece of crap once assembled .
__label__0 had this machine one day before returning it .
__label__0 i bought a $ osterizer and it s a little smaller but does ice quickly and well without problems .
__label__0 don t make the same mistake i made by purchasing this .
__label__0 here are my comments regarding each set : garnet : too dark .
__label__0 i d pick a plan toys train set instead .
__label__0 if you notice the picture of it shows it holding a <UNK> binder .
__label__0 the fragrance of the so called shea butter is quite intense .
__label__0 i really wish i had seen the reviews before i purchased num_extend
__label__0 the blade bends , in my opinion , too num_extend
__label__0 we ran over and pulled out a large wad of threads from his mouth and throat .
__label__0 unless you have money to burn , i d pass this one by .
__label__0 i was surprised how bulky the gloves were , they looked thin and elegant online .
__label__0 so i just bought this based on the bb sales rep s recommendation .
__label__0 it lingers forever , long after you ve finished your last sip and it s not very pleasant .
__label__0 perhaps someone with bad taste will appreciate this terrible game .
__label__0 it seems to make the eyelashes soft , but so far not any length or thickening .
__label__0 during an average cutscene , the graphics look a tad choppy .
__label__0 challenge yourself to get num_num stars on every fight and it s a good action game .
__label__0 i just glued it back together , but it can t swivel anymore .
__label__0 this use to be a fairly good product .
__label__0 there is one more thing you should know .
__label__0 i hadn t read the ingredients until after i made it .

__label__0 i bought this ball for my hyper lab and mixed terrier .
__label__0 i love herbal teas , and thought this was a ginger tea .
__label__0 i purchased this item because there re good review .
__label__0 i was hoping for the larger oxo handle like the paring knife .
__label__0 well , now it is damaged . the only remaining plus for this unit is the vcr .
__label__0 my vet suggested one of these based on her assumption that my dog is anxious .
__label__0 many products contain chemicals and other ingredients that are dangerous and can cause severe allergic reactions .
__label__0 i tasted no vanilla , and the coffee itself was very bitter for a medium roast .
__label__0 contacted citi and they wanted me to send a picture of the cable .
__label__0 would not order this item again it does not really protect cell from breaking if dropped : .
__label__0 the only problem i have is the gun does not feel secure .
__label__0 this causes my feet to slide forward when i walk .
__label__0 a shame too , because it was not cheap .
__label__0 what a mess ! i m so , so , so upset with this cleaner .
__label__0 the ramp pieces just would not stay connected .
__label__0 spend the extra num_num bucks and get a real cutting board .
__label__0 we went out and spent $ and bought some clippers from our vet , which are much sharper .
__label__0 this should have arrived on monday the num_extend it is now the num_extend and it still has not arrived .
__label__0 it s exactly what i m looking for but no way will i pay such a criminal shipping charge .
__label__0 this does not dissolve completely even with hot water .
__label__0 i bought this to hook up a <UNK> to an amp .
__label__0 the first night i set them up they worked perfectly for num_num hours .
__label__0 it has a one year warrantee so this is destined for the trash or for freecycle .
__label__0 party is able to <UNK> the emporer . . . yep that s about it .
__label__0 it does have a nice scent , which dissipates in a matter of hours .
__label__0 num_extend are very unconfortable . i would not buy again them .
__label__0 hope this helps any trying this for that reason .
__label__0 this tripod is suitable for a small digital camera .
__label__0 i also bought moving comfort women s <UNK> bra and i love it great support .
__label__0 if your cold is cured after taking these for just two weeks , well , great i guess .

__label__0 the older ones had battery covers that would not stay on however .

__label__0 they do not even pass the most <UNK> visual comparison to a genuine motorola battery .
__label__0 num_extend + it still does not seem as strong as the young living .
__label__0 too much effort for a one week solution .

__label__0 i wish the device had come with some kind of instructions or support .
__label__0 they are over a month old , and i will probably just wash them down the drain .
__label__0 basically they seem to be crispy green peas .
__label__0 since when did they stop sealing ? the top seemed to be on snug but obviously it wasn t .
__label__0 so i ordered this style in the same size .

__label__0 the metal they used tastes bad like they used old tin cans or something , and they were flimsy .
__label__0 maybe something that expanded when wet or was thick enough to do the job with just one .
__label__0 they don t stretch around the band and are consequently very uncomfortable .
__label__0 the colors are also very hard to blend .
__label__0 i think using a tinted moisturizer is easier to use then this stuff .
__label__0 now i see why so many people complained bitterly about these treatments . all of the brands .
__label__0 everything echoes for some reason when you go down hills of streets <UNK> .

__label__0 still no one could hear me talking and what they did hear sounded like an echo .
__label__0 i have had this product for approximately num_num years .
__label__0 downfall was that the cable only worked for a couple weeks then it completely before it stopped completely .

__label__0 i found my skin was sensitive and it darken my skin . a . l .
__label__0 the mat should be connected to earth ground or placed on a grounded surface .
__label__0 besides the <UNK> allies , the difficulty curve for this game is broken .
__label__0 i like that is is very easy to clean and fill .
__label__0 unfortunately it s a spell , so you have to spend mana on it .
__label__0 when one turns off the unit , it forgets where it was playing .
__label__0 then , as others have mentioned , the temperature dial started sticking .
__label__0 this product did not work well at all .

__label__0 does not work . kind of sad it didnt though , still have half a bottle left .
__label__0 it is the loudest , most obnoxious sound you ll ever num_extend
__label__0 the gameshark intercooler would get a num_num star rating , because it works as advertised .
__label__0 and the lid covering the grinding chamber is screwed on so no more leaky mess .
__label__0 the cursor doesn t always respond well , and is very frustrating .
__label__0 for the life of me , i can t see why this game got so many great reviews .
__label__0 i opened it up and was very surprised at how cheap the attachments were .
__label__0 i have two now , because ihave one for each cat .
__label__0 i do not recommend this product for any reason .
__label__0 linksys tech support can t offer any solutions that you can t read off their website .
__label__0 no <UNK> has been made for the extra attachment .
__label__0 i had to shell out money for a facial with <UNK> to clear everything out .
__label__0 it still didn t work live and learn , i guess .
__label__0 it s their poor design and not the store s fault who sold it .
__label__0 the reason i bought this was the heart rate function .
__label__0 the back of the heel is too low and the shoe easily slips off at the back .
__label__0 way too much money for the quality that it is .
__label__0 you never quite can get things done rapidly enough in or out of battle .
__label__0 buying from amazon was not the best choice in saving money .
__label__0 i really didn t want the money and just wanted the unit replaced .
__label__0 i ordered the motorola roadster num_num after owning the original num_extend motorola hands free car speakerphone for several years .
__label__0 you press different buttons on your controller in different combinations to perform your tasks .

__label__0 i chose to sell it instead of starting over again .
__label__0 they don t break well and don t seem to have a high value for the dogs .
__label__0 i finally found a food that does not cause gas .
__label__0 so if you are looking for something protective i wouldn t recommend this case .
__label__0 every time one of these dialogue sequences comes up , there s loading .
__label__0 the frog in this picture is cute , right ? the one we got .
__label__0 in short , buyer beware , make sure if you purchase it its from a reputable amazon retailer .
__label__0 the only really useful thing is that it has hooks to hang your tools .
__label__0 this product works great as long as you go under num_extend in your car .
__label__0 not what the <UNK> is expecting when it thinks it is getting strawberry .
__label__0 i may try putting my own suction cup on it .
__label__0 as soon as i flipped it over , i saw the cracks in the bottom .
__label__0 that was <UNK> , they taste nothing like pomegranate .

__label__0 each time i would try to <UNK> a movie from my camera , the laptop would shut down .
__label__0 the <UNK> model will do the job , but not comfortably , or as well .
__label__0 i would not buy again even at the sale price .
__label__0 those aren t as neat as the worlds in super mario bros .
__label__0 the underwire was too stiff and felt like it was digging into me .
__label__0 whether you ll like the scent is another matter .
__label__0 even with a lock on it , i am still weary of it opening up .
__label__0 i ve purchased it three times and each tube has lasted less than a month .
__label__0 as soon as i opened the package i knew i made a mistake; this is a piece of junk .
__label__0 the other side of the slice toasted in a striped pattern but the bottom was still white .
__label__0 sound quality was great if you like static . . . cause that is all i heard .
__label__0 for the price , i expected a little better .
__label__0 they are supposed to be neutral and protective but instead they distort .
__label__0 at night , it looked like there were <UNK> s behind me .
__label__0 the original knife has s slight hollow bevel while the new knife is a low performance straight ground edge .
__label__0 the quality is very poor and the pink color is not at all the one shown on the picture .
__label__0 it was not relaxing to us at all .
__label__0 my wife s has held up fine but she hardly uses her phone .
__label__0 they avoid it at all costs , and only eat it when finally they give in to their hunger .
__label__0 amazon gave me the choice to return it or sell it to someone else .
__label__0 i took a recommendation from somebody to try out these lozenges .
__label__0 unfortunately , these peacock brand noodles are yet another food masquerading as healthy .
__label__0 purified water with out minerals will also prevent any mineral deposits to collect on the screen .
__label__0 layed a towel down in the bathroom and went to work .
__label__0 it has a problem playing unless you put a headphone jack in the receptacle , just exactly right .
__label__0 i think the openings are too small to really let them swat at the ball .
__label__0 i buy this product locally all the time at one of the big pet stores .
__label__0 i cannot use this item and neither can i recommend this to a friend .
__label__0 it may work if you have a different phone or model .
__label__0 though i used it for a while , it was definetely not what i expected .
__label__0 it is a great concept , but it doesn t work like the bird .
__label__0 i tried to like this cream and it was not working .
__label__0 i can t even get the usb driver for the device to install on any of my systems .
__label__0 you won t find a single mob in this game it seems .
__label__0 loved it , couldn t get bored or enough of it , chasing my dragon of num_extend multiplayer .
__label__0 the only one of my gadgets it seems to reliably charge is my old kindle .
__label__0 this game is annoying , it will tick you off .
__label__0 it has sugar in it ! awful , awful , awful .
__label__0 first , the <UNK> rating system should either be trashed or severely <UNK> .
__label__0 another major downfall is always having a darn yankee on the cover .
__label__0 so i tossed out all the remaining vitamins to the trash can .
__label__0 also , you do not get the lightening bolt on the battery icon to indicate that it is charging .
__label__0 frankly , after num_num weeks of use , i could not tell if it worked or not .
__label__0 the shaver now quits when there is num_num bars left .
__label__0 the tops dug into my legs and i had to cut them and fix them .

__label__0 why not use stainless steel strainers in all their units ? .
__label__0 you want to make hash browns its better to grate them by hand .
__label__0 plug the device s bulky power adapter in and press the button , and wait .
__label__0 the product arrived in its original case with game booklet .
__label__0 couldn t use as styling cream too heavy , good for a beach day or <UNK> beach .
__label__0 also in the drawer are many , many inexpensive pairs purchased at place s like <UNK> and <UNK> mountain .
__label__0 second , the sides of my small toes were hurting as well , both feet , by afternoon .
__label__0 with so many new things just around the corner think <UNK> it is difficult to justify a purchase here .
__label__0 our dog ignored the toy and wouldn t eat the treats .
__label__0 on one hand , it cooks rice quick under num_num min and the rice comes out really good .
__label__0 luckily we bought it locally and where able to bring it back .
__label__0 it bunches up . i purchase another one on the internet manufactured by universal surgical .
__label__0 you will need to use this a lot of you want to listen to the music on your phone .
__label__0 most were almost like new while only a couple cards appeared very used .
__label__0 i thought it was going to be a nice light beverage like herbal tea .
__label__0 i have a <UNK> that this door is going to dictate the life of this num_extend
__label__0 the cable comes in from the outside and then is split two ways .
__label__0 at first i thought it was due to him getting bored of the food .
__label__0 it is a clever design with a swivel head , but poorly designed .
__label__0 i had this monitor for about a year and half .
__label__0 they almost look like they re stretching sometimes almost .
__label__0 the i got into the menu and changed some things visually .
__label__0 now it s no longer a great deal on quality toilet paper .
__label__0 but this stuff did not work right and cost nearly as much as the real stuff does .
__label__0 working at a <UNK> i have to have winter boots that can withstand the elements .
__label__0 <UNK> has marginal optics , but its only $
__label__0 they sent a num_extend which is supposed to be even better with num_num hours talk time .

__label__0 i can t recommend this to anyone looking to eat a hearty breakfast .
__label__0 miserable little thing died after being used twice .
__label__0 the phone does a factory reset and you lose all info , apps and documents .
__label__0 after hanging up with verizon with no luck , my husband was thinking maybe it s the case .
__label__0 my bike was locked right outside my door to a metal railing with this lock .
__label__0 don t know if the upgrade had an effect , but the router never worked well after that .
__label__0 if you are looking for a decent carpet shampooer , then this is a good buy .
__label__0 we would get out of the box and seek a place with more room to stretch .
__label__0 i tried to find a chain in my jewelry box to put this on to no avail .
__label__0 i m also plagued by sensitive skin and break out with nearly every hair product i try .
__label__0 replaced the batteries and upon using the lcd screen the camera immediately told me the batteries were low .
__label__0 hope you like backtracking cause you ll be doing that allot in this one .
__label__0 i have owned several shavers over the years .
__label__0 for me it was a waste of money .
__label__0 don t know if its salicylic acid itself or if its the company s formulation .
__label__0 it used to be the best wax on the market , they must have changed the ingredients .
__label__0 then as i was removing the product the pain began in other fingers on both hands .
__label__0 there was no way these would be wearable for a day at the office .
__label__0 unlike others , i don t think it s an earth shattering design .
__label__0 park told me to buy a professional wrench if it is used often to remove pedals that were <UNK> .
__label__0 there is little i can say that won t duplicate what others have said .
__label__0 amazon should take this product out of its site .
__label__0 they even came out way before this dud .
__label__0 the price isn t bad for what it gives .
__label__0 this is just an example of sega <UNK> in on the wii hype back than .
__label__0 that s about it however . i would also look at other reviews .
__label__0 it s super cheap and fits very loosely on my car air vent .
__label__0 i researched bluetooth s and this one was supposed to be the best , what a joke .
__label__0 too bad we bought it when it first came out .
__label__0 especially when the really good variety is available .
__label__0 and so far i tried twice but it doesnt really show any color on my face .
__label__0 i was first very disappointed by the smell .
__label__0 i have two of these , and my kids do not like wearing them .
__label__0 that means debris from whatever you re using them for will fall into the palm area .
